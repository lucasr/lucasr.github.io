Currently at Facebook leading teams focused frameworks and tools for
building efficient UIs at scale across iOS and Android. My teams work
on open source projects like [Litho](https://fblitho.com),
[Flipper](https://fbflipper.com), [Yoga](https://yogalayout.com), and
[ComponentKit](http://componentkit.org).

Formerly, I was at Mozilla working on [Firefox for
Android](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/mobile/), one of the highest rated
mobile browsers for Android. Before that, I worked at litl on the development
of the [Webbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litl), a cloud-based
computer for the family; and at Nokia implementing the system UI for the
Maemo-based internet tablets, such as the
[N810](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N810).

Iâ€™ve been a core [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org) contributor in the past where I
have taken several leadership roles such as [GNOME
Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/foundation/) director, Release Team member,
and maintainer of several modules in the project.
