Currently at Meta supporting the Mobile Platform organization, a team of 100+
engineers across the UK and US focused on accelerating high-quality mobile
products at scale through a platform of frameworks and tools for the Family
of Apps i.e. Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Lite.
The team works on open source projects like [Litho](https://fblitho.com),
[GraphQL](https://graphql.org), [Flipper](https://fbflipper.com),
[Yoga](https://yogalayout.com), and [ComponentKit](http://componentkit.org).

Formerly, I was at Mozilla working on [Firefox for
Android](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/mobile/), one of the highest rated
mobile browsers for Android. Before that, I worked at litl on the development
of the [Webbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litl), a cloud-based
computer for the family; and at Nokia implementing the system UI for the
Maemo-based internet tablets, such as the
[N810](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N810).

Iâ€™ve been a core [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org) contributor in the past where I
have taken a number of roles in the community including [GNOME
Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/foundation/) director, Release Team member,
and maintainer of several modules in the project.
