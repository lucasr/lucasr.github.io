I [joined Mozilla](http://lucasr.org/2011/06/14/joining-mozilla/) 3 years, 4
months, and 6 days ago. Time flies!

I was very lucky to join the company a few months before the Firefox Mobile
team decided to rewrite the product from scratch to make it more competitive on
Android. And we _made it_: Firefox for Android is now one of the [highest
rated](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox)
mobile browsers on Android!

This has been the best team I've ever worked with. The talent, energy, and
trust within the Firefox for Android group are simply amazing.

I've thoroughly enjoyed my time here but an exciting opportunity outside
Mozilla came up and decided to take it.

What's next? That's a topic for another post ;-)
