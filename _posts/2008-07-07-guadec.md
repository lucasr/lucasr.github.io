Some quick comments:

  * Istanbul is great: the weather, architecture, ... a nicely chaotic city. Be
  careful with taxi drivers!
  * Met most of my great friends in GNOME. Cool, really cool.
  * As you probably
  [read](http://www.gnome.org/press/releases/2008-07-stormy-executive-director.html),
  Stormy is our executive director now. This is exciting news, really. Welcome
  Stormy!
  * Spent most of the day in board and release team meetings. Good ones.
  * Tomorrow, more meetings, maybe soccer, and more fun, for sure!
