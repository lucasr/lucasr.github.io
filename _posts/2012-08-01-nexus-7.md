I don't usually blog about my new gadgets. But sometimes the gadget is so good
that is worth doing so. It happened
[before](http://lucasr.org/2010/10/02/kindle-3/) when I got my Kindle 3 and now
the same happened with the [Nexus 7](http://www.google.com/nexus/#/7). There
are plenty of Nexus 7 reviews out there. I just want to share some personal
highlights.

## Size and ergonomics

I never felt inclined to buy a 10"; tablet. It might work well as a couch
device at home but it's just too big to carry with me to use on the go. So,
iPad, Touchpad, Galaxy 10.1, and others were never really an option for
me. Furthermore, the current smaller tablet offerings (7" or 8") based
on Android are just too crappy to even consider.

The Nexus 7 is small enough to carry with me all the time and has the right
ergonomics (dimensions, shape, bezel, weight) to use with one and two hands
wherever I am (lying on a couch, standing in the train, holding my new born son
at 2am, etc). The size is also perfect for casual gaming—something that
I had stopped doing for a while. I strongly recommend watching this [interview
with Matias
Duarte](http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/29/3126644/matias-duarte-on-android-4-1-jelly-bean-and-the-nexus-7)
in which he explains the rationale behind Nexus 7's industrial design.

## Performance

The Nexus 7 has chunky specs for the price. Gosh, this is a quad-core Tegra 3
tablet for £199! The combination of performant hardware with the smoothness on
Jelly Bean really improves the UX on the device. There's virtually zero lag on
anything you interact with or do in it. Ah, and battery life is great too.

## Android

ICS was the first release that I felt like the whole Android thing could
actually become something cool. Jelly Bean is yet another big step in the right
direction. It brings tweaks to the task switching and launching flow that make
a subtle but big difference. As a result, Jelly Bean is the very first Android
release that I'm actually enjoying—even with all the little things I still
don't like about it.

The Nexus 7 is a great product due to a combination of factors. It's a nice
piece of hardware for an amazing price that ships the first Android release
that you can feel good about. No, Android is not perfect, Google still has work
to do to make it amazing. But, for now, Nexus 7 is here and is awesome—[Firefox

and [Pattrn](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lucasr.pattrn)
run beautifully on it, by the way :-)
