I've volunteered to be a community steward for the Mobile team as part of the
[Contributor Stewards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Stewards) program that has been
recently created in Mozilla. My role as a community steward is to find ways to
get more people involved in [Firefox Mobile](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile).

As a first step, I thought it would be a good idea to create a [Get
Involved](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Get_Involved) page for the Mobile
team. This page is meant to have only the minimal steps to start contributing
to different areas of the projectâ€”it shouldn't feel overwhelming. For now, it
only has content for hacking and testing but it will include other areas soon.

I have also compiled a [list of
bugs](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=prod%3AFennec+whiteboard%3Amentor)
that are good for first-time contributors and assigned mentors to each of them.
The mentors and other team members will assist you with any missing information
and useful source code links.

If you're still unsure where to start after reading the [Get
Involved](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Get_Involved) page, we're always on
[IRC](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Get_Involved#Communication) to answer any
questions you might have. Firefox Mobile is a key part of Mozilla's future and
is definitely an exciting project to be part of. Join us!
