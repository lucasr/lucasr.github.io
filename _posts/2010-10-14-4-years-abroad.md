    Back in 2006

It turns out that today is a special date which I almost forgot. Back in 2006,
on this same date, 14th of October, Carol and I [took a
flight](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasrocha/315841721/) from Rio de
Janeiro—where my parents-in-law live—to Helsinki where I [started
working](http://lucasr.org/2006/09/20/brand-new-countryjob/) for Nokia as a
member of the [Maemo](http://maemo.org/) UI gang. Today we complete 4 years
living abroad.

Since then, I participated on the
development [three](http://lucasr.org/2007/01/08/n800-is-out/)
[great](http://lucasr.org/2007/10/18/n810-announced/)
[gadgets](http://lucasr.org/2009/11/04/litl-webbook-some-technical-comments/),
[left](http://lucasr.org/2008/03/19/leaving-nokia/) Nokia to
[join](http://lucasr.org/2008/04/14/joining-litl/) my current gig at
[litl](http://litl.com), went through a rather painful process to get our UK
visa, moved to London, we became parents of the most beautiful
little [girl](http://lucasr.org/2010/03/01/julia/) in the whole universe, met a
lot of awesome people from all parts of the world and a few very special
friends, learnt more about other cultures and about
[our own](http://lucasr.org/2010/08/19/strangeness-at-home/), and more. Much
more.

What an awesome journey!
