In preparation for the first tarball release of The Board, I thought it would
be a good time to start setting up some minimal tools for collaboration. In
practice, this means generally using GNOME's infrastructure.

So, I moved the code repository from
[Gitorious](http://gitorious.com/the-board)—of which I think it would be great
to have an instance in GNOME servers by the way—to [GNOME
git](http://git.gnome.org/the-board). I didn't do this before because I only
wanted to start using GNOME git once I felt more confident about the idea.

I've created a basic [wiki page](http://live.gnome.org/TheBoardProject) with
some useful links and, more importantly, a page with [general
instructions](http://live.gnome.org/TheBoardProject/Build) on how to build and
run The Board for hacking purposes. I've just pushed initial code to make The
Board translatable (see image). So I'll soon be doing a call for
translations. There's now a GNOME [bugzilla
product](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/browse.cgi?product=the-board) for The
Board. Feel free to start [filing
bugs](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=the-board)!

I've started using [Flattr](http://flattr.com)—the social micro-payment
system—a couple months ago as an experiment. I added a [The
Board](https://flattr.com/thing/56459/The-Board) entry there. You're welcome to
flattr the project or any of the [related
entries](http://flattr.com/profile/lucasr).

I think it's too early to create a mailing list. I'll do it once the first
releases are out and a certain number of people demonstrate interest in the
project. I expect to be releasing the first 0.1.0 tarball soon!
