I'mÂ  heading to GUADEC tomorrow morning. A lot of Nokians are coming too. Some
of the things I expect to do at GUADEC:

  * [Patchsquad kickoff BoF](http://www.guadec.org/node/563)
  * [GNOME Mobile meeting](http://www.guadec.org/schedule/meetings)
  * Hacking, hacking, hacking
  * Meet new, old and cool GNOMErs
  * Motivate developers to think about GNOME 2.22 Roadmap
  * Pay some beers to my GNOME heroes
  * HAVE FUN!

**See you in Birmingham!**
