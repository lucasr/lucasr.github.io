I really enjoyed my time at Nokia and Finland. I was very lucky to directly
work with very talented and generous people. I've made some good friends here
and it will be hard to say goodbye soon. My last day at Nokia is March 28th.

It's too early to tell about what I'll be doing in the near future. Exciting
stuff, for sure. :-P

**Update:** [Xan](http://blogs.gnome.org/xan/2008/03/19/leaving-nokia/),
[Tommi](http://blogs.gnome.org/tko/2008/03/19/leaving-nokia/) and Johan (who
doesn't have a blog) are leaving too. See you around guys! :-)
