There's nothing special about today's date but I feel it's a good time to write
a bit about my experience at Mozilla so far.

### First days

Joining Mozilla was, at least in the first few weeks, a rather scary
experience. Mostly because it was an unknown territory—both socially and
technically—and I had a lot of catching up to do. The amount of information you
have to assimilate in order to understand how things are done is a bit
overwhelming. But here I am, I survived! And still catching up.

### Remote

One of the main concerns I had when I joined Mozilla was the working-from-home
part. I've done it before but not for so long. It turned out to be a good
experience and enjoyed it in many ways. But I still missed meeting workmates in
person and having a more clearly separate environment for work. So, I'm glad
that the awesome [London
office](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasrocha/sets/72157629476270899/) is now
open!

### Challenges

I  joined Mozilla in a very interesting moment. The company is growing a lot
([we're hiring](http://careers.mozilla.org/en-US/)) and has gone and is still
going through many changes: [new release
pace](http://blog.mozilla.com/channels/category/rapid-release-process/),
[native UI](http://lucasr.org/2011/11/15/native-ui-for-firefox-on-android/) for
Firefox on Android, [Boot to Gecko](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/b2g/),
[Identity](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/), [Open Web
Apps](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/apps/), and much more. New focus, projects,
and products but the [mission](http://www.mozilla.org/about/mission.html) is
still the same.

### Hacker-friendliness

Mozilla is a very friendly environment for hackers: meritocratic, pragmatic,
and virtually bullshit-free. Feels good. You're pretty much free to
decide what to do next with very simple guidance as to what has higher
priority at point in the development process.

### Passion

Mozilla's mission is taken very seriously. You see that reflected in every
small and big decision inside the organization. Being a non-profit organization
with such a worthy mission is very liberating because you can express your
passion with no excuses. Mozillians are _very_ passionate people.

### **Quick stats**

I [joined](http://lucasr.org/2011/06/14/joining-mozilla/) Mozilla 238 days ago.
Since then, as part of my work at the company, I pushed 204 changesets, changed
~7,395 lines of code, fixed 106 bugs, gave 2 talks, travelled to 4 countries,
and met a huge number of smart people.
