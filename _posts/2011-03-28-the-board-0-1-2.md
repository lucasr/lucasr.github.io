It turns out that [The Board](http://live.gnome.org/TheBoardProject)'s distro
[packages](http://lucasr.org/2011/03/22/the-board-in-distros/) were a great
success! The PPA package alone has been downloaded more then 330 times in just
a week. Not bad for package only available for an unreleased version of Ubuntu.
And I'm not even counting the implicit testers using the GNOME 3 [live
image](http://gnome3.org/tryit.html). I've got some useful feedback from early
testers and I expect get even more from now on.

I was planning to finish some new major features before releasing 0.1.2, but a
[serious crash](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=645519) has been
reported and I felt I had to respond to it quickly to avoid losing early
testers. So, I give you [The Board
0.1.2](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2011-March/msg00103.html)!

Besides the crash fix, this release contains a few nice improvements and bug
fixes such as the addition of keyboard shortcuts for aligning and distributing
elements on the page, more subtle window dimming when an element is activated,
and proper saving when multiple elements are dragged. Major features
such as [Cheese
integration](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasrocha/5537309131/) are
probably coming as part of the next release.

I've already pushed the updates to [The Board's
PPA](https://launchpad.net/~the-board-team/+archive/dev-snapshots). If you
already have it in your sources list, you should get it in the next few hours.
I expect openSUSE and Fedora packages to be updated soon. If you haven't tried
The Board yet, what are you waiting for? Follow the instructions from my last
[blog post](http://lucasr.org/2011/03/22/the-board-in-distros/) and start
testing a few minutes!
