I've made my first-ever risotto last Sunday. It's a recipe my mother taught me
during her visit last week. Everyone loved it! I have always thought risottos
are complicated to prepare. Maybe because of that, I have always skipped
risotto recipes when looking for something new to cook. But I was wrong! The
secret is to keep close track of the rice while it's cooking. Here's what
you'll need to serve 4 people with a delicious pork sausage and brown ale beer
risotto:

  * 2 teacups of [Arborio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arborio_rice) rice
  * 400g of your favourite pork sausage
  * 1 big onion
  * 3 table spoons of olive oil
  * 2 pork stock cubes
  * 250ml of brown ale beer
  * 2 teacups of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  * 4 table spoons of butter

The step-by-step instructions:

  1. Boil the sausages for 1-2 minutes, peel their skin, and chop them into
     small pieces
  2. Heat some water in a saucepan and melt the stock cubes in it
  3. In a large saucepan or a [wok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wok), add the
     olive oil, the chopped onion, and the chopped sausages. Cook them until
     the onion is translucent
  4. Add the rice to the saucepan and mix it thoroughly with the onion and
     sausages for a couple minutes
  5. Add the brown ale beer to the saucepan and let it evaporate
  6. From now on, you should keep gradually (a couple ladles at a time) adding
     the water with the melted stock cubes, waiting the water to evaporate,
     then adding more water, and so on. Continuously do that until the rice is
     cooked _al dente._

Once the rice is cooked, remove the saucepan from heat, add the butter and the
grated cheese, mix everything thoroughly and cover the saucepan with a lid.
Leave it for a few minutes before serving. I use
[Newcastle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_Brown_Ale) but I guess you
can use other brown ale beers of your choice. I've seen other risotto recipes
using Emmental cheese instead Parmigiano-Reggiano. The cool thing about
risottos is that once you learn a base recipe it's quite easy to try variations
with different ingredients. Buon appetito!
