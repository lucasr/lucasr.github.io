One of the core goals of
[Pattrn](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lucasr.pattrn) is to
allow users to discover new patterns at any time. As you know, Pattrn [can
automatically set your Android's
wallpaper](http://lucasr.org/2012/05/28/get-a-new-wallpaper-every-day-with-pattrn/)
every day with the patterns of your choice. This is a great way to give your
Android a fresh new look and to discover new patterns—especially if you're
using random pattern wallpapers!

Pattrn shows you the colours used in each pattern inside the extended
information pane that expands and collapses when you tap the screen. The latest
release has a new fun way to discover new patterns: click on a specific colour
and you'll be able to search for other patterns using the same colour (see
image above).

Also new in this update is the "View on Web" option which takes you straight to
the respective pattern page at COLOURlovers.com. Enjoy!
