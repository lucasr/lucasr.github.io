### My head

Two days ago I had the worst headache ever! I think the cause was something I
ate in lunch...

### Movies

  * [Shi mian mai fu](http://imdb.com/title/tt0385004/) (wonderful photography, cool action scenes)
  * [Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow](http://imdb.com/title/tt0346156/) (cool photography too, comic books style)
  * [Finding Nemo](http://imdb.com/title/tt0266543/) (funny but worse than I expected)

### Music

  * [Joss Stone](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:agngtq0zpu43) (nice R&B work)
  * [Norah Jones](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:vsjx7ia3g75r) (jazzy country, folk style)
  * [Jamiroquai](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:fzdfyl18xpsb) (one of my favorites bands though they&#8217;re getting too pop and less acid jazzy)
  * [BNegão e os Seletores de Frequência](http://www.bnegao.com.br/) (hip-hop from Brazil)

### Mastering

I have to write three articles in the next 40 days! Oh shit, I need to hurry...
