The latest issue of the GNOME Journal has just been published. It features
insights into the Portland Project, gained from a conversion with one of its
lead architects, Waldo Bastian, an introduction to GNOME's new deskbar, an
interview with Elijah Newren, GNOME's releaser manager, and three tricks for
designing application interfaces you should know. Writers of this edition are
