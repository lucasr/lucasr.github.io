Dear GNOME maintainers, the deadline to reply the roadmap information request
for your modules is **May 7**. It's very important to have your replies
so that we can have a high quality roadmap for our next stable releases.

To know more about the Roadmap Process, go to:

<http://live.gnome.org/RoadMap/Process>

To keep track of all the gathered Roadmap information, go to:

<http://live.gnome.org/RoadMap/Modules>

The Roadmap Process is going really well so far and I think we'll be able to
spot some really nice things about us as a community (_I'll blog about it
later_).
