Just a quick note about amazing things I've seen in the last few days...

Last saturday, September 22, Carol and I went to this freakingly extraordinary
show of [Cirque du Soleil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirque_du_Soleil)
called
"[Delirium](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/delirium_europe/about/default.htm)".

Today, I watched this documentary called "[Before the Music
Dies](http://www.beforethemusicdies.com/)" (I bought the DVD through their
online store). If you're a music geek or just fan, you must watch this movie!
One cool sidenote is that they _(B-Side, the independent distributor behing
this movie)_ have this interesting business model which allows you to
pay a very low price to download a DRM-free video file from their website. One
of my favorite quotes from this movie:

> _"Today, Ray Charles would not get a shot. Today, Stevie Wonder would not get
> a shot. They are blind."_ (Branford Marsalis, about the music business)

I don't know how my life would be without music... without art...
