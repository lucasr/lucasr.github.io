  * Moved to a better/cheaper/larger apartment in the same cool area in London.
  Perfect! After all the hassle of the move, we are really enjoying our new
  home and neighborhood!
  * Work at [litl](http://www.litl.com) is fastly and intensely moving forward.
  So intense that I've been feeling a bit burnt out for GNOME stuff... I'm
  trying to catch up with my long list of pending GNOME tasks now.
  * Really glad that we managed to come up with a plan for [GNOME
  3](http://live.gnome.org/ThreePointZero/Plan). There are still a lot of open
  questions which I hope will be answered as we move on the schedule. Another
  great move was our migration to [git](http://live.gnome.org/Git). We've got a
  very positive atmosphere inside the community now. That's awesome!
  * Cultural life in London simply rocks. I went to Stomp and Mama Mia,
  concerts of Richard Bona, Bosco de Oliveira, Vanessa da Mata, Ben Harper, a
  bunch of nice museums, parks, neighborhoods, open markets, etc, and planning
  to go to many more! That's something I really missed in Finland.
  * For some reason, my english accent tends to be a bit too American but I
  like the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">British</span> English
  accent much more. I'm practicing my <span style="text-decoration:
  line-through;">British</span> English "Hello" and "So..." everyday. Maybe at
  some point I'll have a a perfectly pronounced "Hello" but then there are all
  the other words to get the pronunciation right :-P
  * Traveled to the simply beautiful Prague
  ([photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasrocha/sets/72157615732935558/))
  in March and to the weirdly amazing Amsterdam
  ([photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasrocha/sets/72157617479396251/),
   some more uploads pending...) in April. More travels being planned, yay!
  * Got [LittleBIGPlanet](http://www.littlebigplanet.com/): fun, fun, fun. It's
  the only game my wife and I get to play together (as she doesn't like to play
  most of the games we have). So, it's double fun for us.
  * Looking forward to getting a new DSLR camera soon. I'm getting very annoyed
  by the unstable handling and the small viewfinder of my Canon 350D. I've
  heard Canon 450D has some good improvements over the 350D but I'm leaning
  towards a Canon 40D... Suggestions for camera models, places to sell my used
  camera, and stores with good deals for new cameras are welcome.
  * Two awesome apps I started to use recently: [GNOME
  Do](http://do.davebsd.com/) and [Miro](http://www.getmiro.com/).
  * Latest playlist includes: Holly Golightly, Erykah Badu, Ornette Coleman,
  John Coltrane, Soulive, The New Mastersounds, Jill Scott, Amel Larrieux,
  Anthony Hamilton, Miles Davis, Fiona Apple, Sonny Rollins, Roberto Mendes,
  Stanton Moore, Ben Harper, Clube do Balan√ßo, Black Rio, a lot more. Actually,
  I feel it's time to renew my music collection with some new albums...
  * I'm in [Twitter](http://twitter.com/lucasratmundo) now. It took some time
  until I got the point of microblogging. So far, it's been an interesting
  experience.
  * That's all for now. Time to sleep.
