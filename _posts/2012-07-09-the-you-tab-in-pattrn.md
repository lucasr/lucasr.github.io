I've just pushed a new
[Pattrn](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lucasr.pattrn)
update with an exciting new feature: the _You_ tab. It replaces the Favorites
tab in the home screen with a simple dashboard that gives you direct access to
all your stuff.

In addition to your favorite patterns, the _You_ tab offers easy access to all
patterns you've used as wallpaper and your saved searches. You can add saved
searches to the _You_ tab by using the â˜… button in the search results screen.
Saved searches are a nice way to keep a dynamic list of patterns by keyword or
color.

This new update is also an important milestone in terms of getting the
necessary infrastructure to build the tablet UI for Pattrn. Stay tuned!
