Things are going pretty well for
[Pattrn](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lucasr.pattrn). In
just 22 days, it has got almost 600 downloads, got featured in two Android app
[design](http://androidniceties.tumblr.com/post/22960632142/pattrn-google-play-link)
[blogs](http://android-app-patterns.com//search/pattrn),  and got mostly 5-star
ratings on Google Play. Not bad! Since its [initial
release](http://lucasr.org/2012/05/07/introducing-pattrn/), Pattrn got the
ability to save patterns to your Android gallery, a few UI improvements, and
some nice performance and stability fixes.

Based on your feedback, I have now pushed an update with a new little feature:
automatic wallpaper updates. You can now tell Pattrn to automatically set your
Android's wallpaper every day or every week with your favourite or most popular
patterns. Feeling adventurous? You can also set Pattrn to use a completely
random pattern as your wallpaper.

Once you update Pattrn on your device and run it for the first time, you'll be
prompted to setup the automatic wallpaper updates. Don't worry, you can change
those options at any time in the Settings screen—accessible via the app menu.

Be inspired by a new [COLOURlovers](http://www.colourlovers.com/) pattern every
day! [Download Pattrn
now](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lucasr.pattrn) on Google
Play!
