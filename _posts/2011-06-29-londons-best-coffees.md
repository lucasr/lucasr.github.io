As a good Brazilian, I love good coffee. Here's a short list of my favourite
coffee shops in London. Most of them are in central London because they are
close to litl's office in Tottenham Court Road, where I worked for more than
two years.

## Monmouth

I usually go to their Covent Garden branch at Monmouth Street. Small, cosy, and
earthy. They have [two other branches](http://www.monmouthcoffee.co.uk/Shops).
They import and provide coffee for restaurants too. For instance, my [favourite
pizza place](http://lucasr.org/2010/09/12/franco-manca/) in London serves
Monmouth's coffee. Perfect combination!

## Milk Bar

Tiny coffee shop at Bateman street. Young and indie atmosphere. They expose art
work from local artists in their shop, pretty cool.

## Tapped & Packed

They are at Rathbone Place, number 26. Keep the street number in mind because
the name of the shop is not shown anywhereâ€”as far as I could see. They serve
the tallest Victoria sponge I've ever seen!

## Sacred

This is a little coffee place inside the Westfield shopping centre in Shepherds
Bush. They have the creamiest flat white. Delicious!

If you have any other suggestions, please post them as comments. I'm definitely
looking forward to hearing about other good coffee places in the city!
