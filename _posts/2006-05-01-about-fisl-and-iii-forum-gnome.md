Well, as most of you probably know, the [7th Fórum Internacional Software
Livre](http://fisl.softwarelivre.org) and the [III Fórum
GNOME](http://forum.gnome.org/index-en.html) took place at Porto Alegre/RS
(Brazil) on April 19-22. FISL had more than 5k atendees this year which is an
impressive number! Free software people from several countries came to Porto
Alegre, mainly from Brazil, Uruguai, U.S., Canada and Argentina. About 275 talk
were given by 445 speakers. The III Fórum GNOME happened as a community event
of FISL. The schedule was composed by 9 talks with 7 speakers.

First of all, I'd like to loudly say **THANK YOU** to GNOME Foundation for
covering my travel expenses. Without it I would not be able to attend FISL and
Fórum GNOME this year.

I arrived on April 16 at Porto Alegre (POA) &#8211; three days before FISL
because going to Porto Alegre was a wonderful chance to meet some really good
friends (Terceiro, Machado e Lucasa) from Bahia who live there. Vinnie, one of
my best friends who is living is São Paulo now went to POA too. From 16 to 19
the weather was really cold. At least for me... I spent those 3 days
finishing my slides and going for a walk in the talk.

In the first FISL day, I met [Thomas](http://thomas.apestaart.org/) just before
my [talk on GNOME Desktop
2.14](http://www.gnome.org/~lucasr/files/gnome-2.14.odp). My talk had a good
number of people in attendance &#8211; the room quite full! Unfortunately,
Thomas's talk on GStreamer was at the same time of mine so I couldn't
attend it. I spent the rest of the day trying to put my Dlink DWL-122
USB wireless key to work on Ubuntu Dapper with no success. ;-/

In the second day (20/04) morning, I saw [Aaron
Seigo](http://aseigo.blogspot.com/)'s talk on KDE4 and Plasma Workspace.
Well, the talk was really interesting. In fact, based on what he said, there's
still a long way to get KDE4 and Plasma on a beta functional state but the
point here is that they seem to have a strutured conceptual **plan** for their
next generation version. Something that I think we, GNOME, still don't have it
very clear. All we have is an open brainstorming (which is not very effective
for practical purposes) with some interesting experimental projects. In
the afternoon, I attended [Zack
Rusin](http://www.kdedevelopers.org/blog/14)'s talk on technologies for
the free desktops which covered some of the latest cool things of X.org and
their relation with KDE4. This was a very informative talk, quite nice too.
[fatalerror](http://live.gnome.org/GuilhermePastore) arrived in the morning (as
far as I remember). Really cool to meet him again on Fórum GNOME.
[Johan](http://www.async.com.br/~jdahlin/) arrived in the afternoon.

The third day began with [Miguel](http://tirania.org/)'s talk on latest
Linux desktop Novell technologies (Xgl, compiz, Beagle, F-Spot, Banshee and
others). The audience got very impressed with what Miguel presented
there. After Miguel's talk, Thomas gave a talk on Flumotion and related Python
stuff. Although there were too many slides on his presentation (hehe), his talk
was really cool. Then, I went the fatalerror's talk on how to contribute to
GNOME. He gave an overview of the several activities of the projects with
initial references for each of them. After his talk, lots of people came to him
to get more information. I hope to see more brazilians involved in GNOME...
Later in the afternoon, Johan gave a talk on best practices on Python GUI
development to a big audience. At night, I, Thomas, Johan,
[Kiko](http://www.async.com.br/~kiko/) and some
[Async](http://www.async.com.br/) and [Python
Brasil](http://www.pythonbrasil.com.br) guys went to a restaurant
to eat some good and cheap food.

fatalerror had to cover [kov](http://live.gnome.org/GustavoNoronha)'s
talk about Debian GNOME team because kov could not attend FISL this year. So, I
had cover fatalerror's talk on GNOME Platform. The fourth and last day began
with the preparation of this talk. I finished the slides 15 minutes before the
schedule. I got in the room a litle bit nervous (I don't like to prepare talks
with that short time) and to get things even better my ibook's VGA
output didn't work. Fortunately, Kiko lent me his laptop and helped me during
the talk. Thanks a LOT kiko! Well, I didn't like my talk but some people told
me it was nice. What can I say? At night, I, Thomas, Johan, Scott Balneaves
(LSTP), Keith Packard (X.Org), Jim McQuillan (LTSP), Marlon Dutra (ASL.Org and
FISL organization) and Carlos Canto (Propus) went to the [best barbecue
restaurant of Porto Alegre](http://www.fogodechao.com/). It was veeery funny!

One of the negative aspects of this Fórum GNOME edition was that we didn't get
sponsors to produce marketing material. I really missed this. I hope to get it
on future Fórum GNOME editions.

Every time I go to free software events I remember that free software is all
about people. It was wonderful to meet so many cool people at FISL and Fórum
GNOME.

As soon as I get back my camera USB cable, I'll upload the pictures I took at
Porto Alegre. For now, you can have a look at [Thomas'
ones](http://thomas.apestaart.org/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=14445).
