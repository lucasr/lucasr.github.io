I started at Mozilla on this same date last year. It was a Wednesday and I was
a bit scared. Fast forward 365 days and here I am completing my first year in
the company! Wow, time really flies! I've already
[written](http://lucasr.org/2012/03/13/my-first-238-days-at-mozilla/) about my
experience in the first 238 days at Mozilla and the same points still apply.
Maybe it's a good time to make a quick summary of what I've worked on in my
first year.

I was lucky to join Mozilla at the time the mobile front-end team was about to
start working on the then-new [XUL-based tablet
UI](http://lucasr.org/2011/09/13/firefox-for-tablets-on-nightly/). I
implemented central parts of the UI such as the tabs side-pane and important
pieces of the browser toolbar—besides the usual bug fixes. It was a nice way to
get more familiar with XUL-based development. I also implemented things like
[HTML5 form
validation](http://lucasr.org/2011/09/20/html5-form-validation-in-firefox-mobile/)
front-end in XUL Fennec in the same period.

Around September last year, I
[volunteered](http://lucasr.org/2011/10/10/get-involved-in-firefox-mobile/) to
be Firefox Mobile's community steward. The first thing I did was to create an
official [Get Involved](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Get_Involved) page and
compile a list of good first bugs for new contributors. The response has been
pretty good and I do want to dedicate a bit more time for contributor
engagement in the near future.

Then in October, the Firefox Mobile team got together in Toronto to start
working on the [new native
UI](http://lucasr.org/2011/11/15/native-ui-for-firefox-on-android/). On this
front, I drove the development of core parts of the new UX including the
AwesomeBar screen and the new start page. Furthermore, I led the implementation
of important back-end components such as the Places database for Android (and
respective test infrastructure) and the [Remote
Debugger](http://lucasr.org/2012/03/28/remote-debugging-in-firefox-mobile/)
support. As you probably know, I'm now working on [Reader
Mode](http://lucasr.org/2012/06/21/reader-mode-in-firefox-mobile/).

Some quick stats: I [joined](http://lucasr.org/2011/06/14/joining-mozilla/) Mozilla 365 days ago. Since then, I pushed 280 changesets, changed ~12,578 lines of code, fixed 150 bugs, gave 3 talks, travelled to 5 countries, and had a lot of fun. For my next year at Mozilla, I want to focus on bootstrapping more exciting features that differentiate Firefox Mobile from competitors—Reader Mode being the first of them.

I have no doubts that my next year at Mozilla will be filled with even more awesomeness!
