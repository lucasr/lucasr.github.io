This weekend was very nice. On friday I played with Paroano Sai Milhó in the
[Vitória da Conquista](http://www.citybrazil.com.br/ba/vitoriaconquista/)
carnival. On saturday, I played with
[Pã](http://www.tramavirtual.com.br/gvirtual/artista/index_2.jsp?id=5162). Both
shows were diferently nice.

Me and Carol watched three movies in a raining sunday: [I, Robot](
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343818/), [Heist](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252503/)
and [Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/).
The first one is interesting but not that good. The second has a good story
full of turnovers. The third is great! Very exciting! A great work of Jim
Carrey and Kate Winslet.

I'm [The Skin of Culture](

by Derrick de Kerckhove (the director of the [McLuhan Program in Culture & Technology](
http://www.mcluhan.utoronto.ca/)). He presents interesting thoughts about our
"relation" with television and other media. The concepts of
psicotechnologies and technopsicology are very interesting too.
