[Mark Finkle](starkravingfinkle.org/) and [Margaret
Leibovic](http://blog.margaretleibovic.com/) are flying to London next week to
attend [Droidcon](http://uk.droidcon.com/2013/) and the [Mozilla
Festival](http://mozillafestival.org). So we thought it would be a good
opportunity to give a series of tech talks on the present and future of Mozilla
products and web platform on Android in our London MozSpace.

We'll be talking about [Firefox for
Android](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/mobile/features/), our beloved
mobile browser; GeckoView, the upcoming API for embedding Gecko in Android
apps; the latest add-on APIs to extend Firefox for Android; as well as some
cool demos of Mozilla's runtime platform and developer tools for Open Web apps
on Android.

The talks will be followed by free drinks and pizzas in our community space.
Interested? Register now at the [event
page](http://mozillaonandroid.eventbrite.co.uk).

And by the way, if you're attending Droidcon this year, I'll be giving a
[talk](http://uk.droidcon.com/2013/sessions/bringing-firefox-to-android/)
covering some of the most interesting technical details behind Firefox for
Android.

Hope to see you next week!
