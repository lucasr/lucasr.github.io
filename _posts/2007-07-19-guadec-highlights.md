  * I think my [talk](http://guadec.org/node/561) about Hildon Desktop went
  quite nicely. Well, that's what I've heard from the attendees :-)
  * Some interesting ideas came out from
  [Havoc](http://log.ometer.com/)&#8216;s and
  [Bryan](http://www.gnome.org/~clarkbw/)&#8216;s keynote about Online Desktop.
  I still don't see much sense in something like Big Board or an online-only
  desktop flavor. But yes, we need to take the new web services into account in
  GNOME Desktop in interesting ways. I have some ideas for Eye of GNOME plugins
  for instance. :-P
  * Very strong presence of GNOME mobile related people in GUADEC. I'm pretty
  excited about what is yet to come in this area. Yay!
  * I love the stickers that came in the conference bag!
  * The [GUADEC 2007](http://flickr.com/groups/guadec2007/pool/) group in
  Flickr group has some nice shots
  * [Mirco](http://macslow.thepimp.net/) brought some interesting ideas and
  demo in his [talk](http://guadec.org/node/541) about a possible next
  generation GNOME Desktop. There are lots of yet-to-be-answered questions on
  this subject but I think it's always good to see people bringing fresh new
  ideas for discussion.
  * [Xan](http://blogs.gnome.org/xan/) and
  [Fer](http://www.gnome.org/~fherrera/blog) rocked our world with an awesome
  intro talk for the GTK+ 3.0 BoF! It's cool to see the GTK+ community starting
  to consider in a more concrete way the next iteration of our beloved toolkit.
  * I commited a patch by [Hubert](http://www.figuiere.net/hub/blog/) that adds
  XMP support to Eye of GNOME (based on exempi). Hub, you rock!
  * [Vincent](http://www.vuntz.net/) can't say &#8220;Hello&#8221; with a
  british accent. HA HA HA! Dude, I love you!
  * [Danilo](http://danilo.segan.org/blog/), Da Da Da! Dje!
  * [Etrunko](http://etrunko.blogspot.com/), thanks for lending me your iPod
  with loads of cool &#8220;caipira&#8221; songs!
  * Very nice to meet again [Thomas](http://thomas.apestaart.org/log/),
  [Andreas](http://www.andreasn.se/blog/),
  [Claudio](http://www.gnome.org/~csaavedra/), Izabel and many others!
