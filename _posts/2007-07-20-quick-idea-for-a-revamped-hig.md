I just wanted to blog about it before I forget. I had a nice chat with
[Andreas](http://www.andreasn.se/blog/) and this idea came out.

Well, everybody knows that our beloved Human Interface Guidelines (aka HIG)
needs an update. There are some missing bits for new use cases and the
current content needs to be updated for the current desktop (although most
of the document seems to be still quite valid). I guess I don't
need to argue about the importance of those guidelines to GNOME usability
and UI consistency, right?

My main use case as an user of HIG is to open its [table of
contents](http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/2.0/) and search for a
section related to the topic I'm trying to deal with in my UI. So, would it be
nice if the HIG became some kind of a UI guidelines knowledge base? This way we
can easily keep the guidelines updated and evolve it every time we find out
about a new use case.

Each entry in this knowledge base would provide guidelines for a specific use
case or behavior (keyboard shortcuts, search, zooming, drag and drop, etc) or
UI element (statusbar, toolbar, menubar, dialogs, panels, etc). Entries could
be marked as deprecated and have different versions. Of course, entries could
be tagged as well. The initial webpage could have just a search entry and a
sane topics tree, tag cloud (or a kind of table of contents). The entries could
be submitted by anyone but it would be moderated and improved/fixed by the
GNOME Usability experts.

Well, this was just a random idea. I don't really plan to work on that. I hope
it can be an inspiration and bring some motivation to update our HIG and make
it rock even more! :-P
