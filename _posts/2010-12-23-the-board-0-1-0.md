    The Board 0.1.0
  </p>
</div>

Today I'm officially joining the GNOME Old Farts Club. I thought it would be a
good time to make the first release of [The
Board](http://live.gnome.org/TheBoardProject). Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
[The Board
0.1.0](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2010-December/msg00051.html)! I
wanted to do this a few weeks ago but with so many moving parts in our platform
it was actually a bit hard to reach a point where all dependencies were
actually working fine together. So, what is this release about?

**Feedback.** First of all, this is not a release for users. The Board is
buggy, unstable, and lacking features at the moment. But it's in a dogfoodable
state for developers and expert Linux users. Current feature list includes:

  * Add, load, remove pages
  * Photo, video, note and label elements
  * Add, edit, remove, resize elements in a page
  * Basic Firefox and Chrome extensions
  * Basic Nautilus extension

I'm expecting to get some useful feedback from early testers and developers on
those features and the general UX. You can get an idea of what's in the release
by having a look at the previous blog posts and respective videos listed in The
Board's [wiki page](http://live.gnome.org/TheBoardProject).

**Contributors.** If you're a developer interested in setting up a development
environment to start hacking on The Board, have a look at the [hacking
page](http://live.gnome.org/TheBoardProject/Hacking). I wrote a script—heavily
based on what [GNOME
Shell](http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-shell/tree/tools/build) provides—that
automates most of the process of fetching and building dependencies from git.
Please [report](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=the-board) any
build problems on GNOME Bugzilla. I filed bug reports for quite a few [known
bugs and missing
features](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=product:%22the-board%22+)
that should be a good source for initial contributions.

**Distros.** Even though building The Board and its dependencies became much
easier with the above-mentioned script, it's might still be a bit painful to
get The Board running on your system. So, here's a call for distro packagers to
create easy-to-install packages to be used by early testers. The idea is to be
able to provide the simplest possible way to get The Board running on all major
Linux distros.

So, what's next? ****I'll continue to fix bugs and hopefully make a 0.2.0
release soon with a couple of new features: audio elements with voice recording
capability and support for actions—align, distribute, remove, etc—on multiple
elements in a page. I expect to be doing more frequent releases from now on.
