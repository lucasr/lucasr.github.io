EOG "super-exciting" 2.13.2 release is out! It has lots of bug fixes and an
awesome UI rework. There's still much to do but EOG is already a much nicer app
now. See [NEWS](http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/eog/NEWS) for detailed
list of changes. I received several positive feedback from users and developers
what makes me very happy! :-)

Zenity 2.13.2 is released too. No exciting stuff for now but 2.13.3 will have
useful-nice-litle-features!

I and Carol watched some movies (and ate **a lot**) this weekend:

  * [The Interpreter](http://imdb.com/title/tt0373926/) (crap)
  * [The Machinist](http://imdb.com/title/tt0361862/) (nice!)
  * [Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever](http://imdb.com/title/tt0308208/) (normal action movie)

Music:

  * [BNegão](http://www.bnegao.com.br)
  * [Zezé di Camargo e Luciano](http://www.zezedicamargoeluciano.com.br/) (hehe, I know, they are crap but have some nice songs)
