So, as Havoc had already [pre-announced](http://log.ometer.com/2008-10.html#9),
we just released the [0.1](ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gjs/0.1/)
version of Gjs, the javascript bindings with which we're doing all the crazy
stuff at litl. The [code](http://svn.gnome.org/svn/gjs/trunk/) is in GNOME svn.
We've created this really dummie [wiki page](http://live.gnome.org/Gjs) now.
Feel free to test it and send us cool patches to improve it.
