The GNOME Roadmap for 2.22 (and partially for 2.24 and future 2.x releases) is
available at:

<http://live.gnome.org/RoadMap>

The GNOME Roadmap is a big-picture view of functionality we expect GNOME to
include in short-term and long-term future. The roadmap is based on feedback
from current GNOME developers and other community members.

We hope this roadmap increases the awereness about the future steps of the
project inside and outside the community and helps us to look forward and plan
where we want to go.

Big thanks to everyone who contributed with information and reviews!
