As I [told you before](http://blogs.gnome.org/view/lucasr/2007/01/29/0),
[Hildon
Desktop](https://stage.maemo.org/svn/maemo/projects/haf/trunk/hildon-desktop/)
now has a new plugin system and one of the cool things about it is the Python
support. Just for the sake of demonstration, I recorded a
[screencast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screencast) with the step by step
process of writing a "Hello World" Python plugin for the Home area of Hildon
Desktop.

[<img style="border: 0px initial initial;" src="http://lucasr.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/plugin-howto.jpg" border="0"/>](http://www.gnome.org/~lucasr/misc/hildondesktop-plugin1.ogg)

Yes, it's really simple. Of course, this is a useless plugin but I just wanted
to demonstrate how easy and simple is to have the basic infrastruture done.

Enjoy!

**Update 1:** the GIF image is too heavy and people are having problems to
watch the screencast. I'll upload a new (and better) file tomorrow as soon as
possible. Sorry for the inconvenience. :-/

**Update 2:** I removed the link to the screencast for now just to avoid other
people to have the same problem and complain about the same thing.

**Update 3** The link is updated with a new/more-complete version of the
screencast.
