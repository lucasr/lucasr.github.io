I and Carol are going to move to Helsinki in the middle of October. The reason:
I've got a new job at [Nokia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia). I'll work on
the [Maemo](http://www.maemo.org/) project. We're just waiting for the visa. As
genuine latin americans, south americans, brazilians, brazilian northeasters,
from Bahia state, from Salvador city, I'm sure that living in
Europe/Scandinavia/Finland/Helsinki will be a huge change for us in all
the aspects.

I'm very excited about this brand new job because it's the first time I have a
job where I'll work directly/indirectly on the stuff I could only do in my free
time: GNOME and open source/free software hacking. Yay!

Last saturday, we had a party to celebrate our moving to Finland and our
marriage!

some photos.

Thanks everyone for all the positive wishes (phone calls, e-mail, blog posts,
blog comments, etc) about my marriage!
