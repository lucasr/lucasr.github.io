    The Board 0.1.1
  </p>
</div>

Here we go again. About a month ago, I made the [first-ever
release](http://lucasr.org/2010/12/23/the-board-0-1-0/) of [The
Board](http://live.gnome.org/TheBoardProject). Now it's time to roll a new
release with some pretty nice features and bug fixes. So, what's new in [The
Board
0.1.1](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2011-February/msg00000.html)?

  * [Sound elements with Voice Memo support](http://lucasr.org/2011/01/10/sounds-in-the-board/)
  * [Select, move, align, distribute, and remove multiple elements](http://lucasr.org/2011/01/26/selection-in-the-board/)
  * [Five brand-new page backgrounds](http://lucasr.org/2011/01/14/backgrounds-in-the-board/)

It also has a couple of important bug fixes such
as [637703](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=637703) and
[637484](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=637484). Just like 0.1.0,
this is not a release for end-users. The Board is currently unstable, buggy,
and often loses data. Early testers are more than welcome though—to
provide general feedback and [report
bugs](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=the-board). Distro
packages for 3 popular distros (Ubuntu, Fedora, and openSUSE) are coming
soon—I will announce them in my blog, don't worry. That should help early
testers get started easily.

## Versioning

I decided to use the classic odd-unstable/even-stable style of versioning. This
is a common practice in GNOME and should be natural for most contributors in
the community. In terms of milestones, this means that you'll see a bunch of
0.1.x development releases from now on and 0.2.0 will be the first release for
end-users. I honestly have no final answer as to when 0.2.0 is going to happen
yet.

## What's next

I will be rolling a new development release (0.1.2) in the next few
weeks—depends on the amount of spare I end up having. I'll focus on two things:
toolbars and element stacking. I'll do a second design iteration on the
toolbars with focus on scalability. In practice, this means fixing bugs like
[636637](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=636637) and
[636634](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=636634). Element stacking
is the final major feature for [multiple
elements](http://lucasr.org/2011/01/26/selection-in-the-board/) which I ended
up moving to 0.1.2. You'll be able to create stacks of elements in the page.
I'm quite excited about this one!
