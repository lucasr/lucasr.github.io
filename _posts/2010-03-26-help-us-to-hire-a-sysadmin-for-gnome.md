As you've probably seen, we've put a nice Friends of GNOME goal tracking ruler
on top of GNOME's [website](http://www.gnome.org), [Planet
GNOME](http://planet.gnome.org) and in [Friends of GNOME
page](http://www.gnome.org/friends). This is a strong promotion strategy to
attract attention to Foundation's current goal to hire a
[sysadmin](http://live.gnome.org/Sysadmin/AdvisoryMeeting/JobDescription) for
GNOME. The strategy seems to be working quite well! In the three days since the
ruler was published, we've got around $1,500 in donations from Friends of GNOME
and $5,000 from Collabora, joining other three companies Canonical, Google, and
Nokia.

As of today, we're only $4,602 from reaching the goal and we need your contribution! Help us getting more donors by:

  * Blogging about our campaign and pointing people to [Friends of GNOME
  page](http://www.gnome.org/friends).
  * Tweeting _"Help the GNOME Foundation to hire a sysadmin for GNOME!
  http://www.gnome.org/friends"_ on Twitter, Identi.ca, Facebook, and any of
  your favorite microblogging sites.
  * Add one of the [Friends of GNOME
  badges](http://www.gnome.org/friends/promote.html) in your website or blog.
  * Spread the word about the campaign among your friends, local Free Software
  communities, user groups, etc.

We're very close to get to hire a sysadmin for GNOME! Let's make it happen!
