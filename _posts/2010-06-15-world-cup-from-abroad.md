I used to be an avid football fan but I gradually stopped watching it
throughout the last few years for some reason. But it's World Cup time and I
just feel like watching football everyday again! This is the first time I watch
a World Cup from abroad. This definitely changes the way you experience and
perceive the whole thing.

First of all, the national team is not your team. Duh. The local TV channel
here focus on the [English
team](http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/teams/team=43942/index.html), of course.
Newspapers don't talk much in detail about the Brazilian team. So, you need to
pro-actively dig information about your own team — otherwise you just don't
know what's going on. This is something I'm not used to because, while in
Brazil, you basically end up knowing everything about the Brazilian team by
[osmosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis) as everyone — friends, family,
newspapers, TV channels — only talk about it during the whole World Cup.

It's also interesting to realise how different is the relationship English
people have with their team. In Brazil, people always have extremely high
expectations. If our team doesn't completely destroy the opponent with a 3-0
(or more) score, we just don't feel like we were convincing as a team. "Just"
winning with a 1-0 score is not enough, sorry. In England, my impression is
that people have more balanced expectations about their team. They are cheery
but cautious — even with the great team they have this year. Maybe it's due to
several disappointments from past World Cups. I don't know.

All in all, I love World Cups and I'll definitely watch as many games as
possible. I'm not so excited about the [Brazilian
team](http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/teams/team=43924/index.html) this year but I
know we're one of the favourites for the Cup anyway! Go Brazil! Go!
