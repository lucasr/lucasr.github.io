The 3rd edition of [Festival Software Livre da
Bahia](http://festival.softwarelivre.org) was really great! Nice people, cool
talks and a lots of GNOME stuff. I gave one basic talk about free software and
one about the GNOME Project (with focus on contribution). Also, two workshops,
one about brazilian portuguese l10n and another about "how to send your
first patch to GNOME". I'm very happy with the results of these activities
and with the event as a whole.
