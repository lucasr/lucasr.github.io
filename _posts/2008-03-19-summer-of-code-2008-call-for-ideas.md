As [Adam](http://sadamclemson.blogspot.com/2008/03/gnome-soc-2008.html) has
already announced, if you are GNOME developer and want GNOME to rock on the
[Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc) this year, don’t forget to
add your ideas to our [SoC project ideas
page](http://live.gnome.org/SummerOfCode2008/Ideas). We've got many ideas
already but I'm sure we can have more. Go Go Go!
