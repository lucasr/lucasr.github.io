The deadline for replying the roadmap info request is today and there are still
quite many modules without fresh roadmap. I decided to wait on more week for
the replies before starting to prepare the first draft.

Maintainers and developers, wake up! Reply today and win a nice trip to the
moon! Just let me know if you haven't seen any roadmap request in your
inbox.
