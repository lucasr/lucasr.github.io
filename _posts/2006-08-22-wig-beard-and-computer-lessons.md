Today I decided to clean my ibook because it was so dirty. Actually, it was
getting grey. When I was cleaning the keyboard I found a lot of hair bellow the
keys. I could even produce a wig with that hair!

What is intriguing is that most the hair I found in the keyboard was
concentrated around the letters "a", "w", and "s". Most of the hair seems to
come from my beard. Some things I learnt from this:

  1. My hair is mostly falling from the left side of my head. Probably, some
     day I'll become a left-balded man. This will be horrible!
  2. When I'm thinking about cool things (mostly in front of a computer) I use
     to pull my beard off.

Computers gives you wonderful oportunities to know yourself!
