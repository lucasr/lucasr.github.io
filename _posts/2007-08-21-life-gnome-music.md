For some reason, It's been about 2 weeks that I feel very tired all the time. I
guess this is a combination of work load and post-mastering. Unfortunately,
because of that, I've been a little bit away from my usual GNOME
activities. I guess I'll be 100% back from next week on.

Congratulations to all GNOME contributors for the project's [10 years
anniversary](http://www.gnome.org/press/releases/gnome10years.html)! I consider
myself a quite recent contributor. IIRC, my first contribution to the project
was in September 13, 2004. It was a small
[patch](http://svn.gnome.org/viewcvs/zenity/trunk/src/fileselection.c?view=markup&pathrev=516)
that added save support for the file selection dialog in zenity.
[Glynn](http://blogs.gnome.org/gman/) was zenity's maintainer at that time.
Actually, (I don't know if he knows that) Glynn is definitely my primary GNOME
hero because it was him who brought me inside the project and the community.
Without his support in my first contributions, I don't know if I would be so
active (and passionate) to the project today. **Thank you dude!**

As a relaxing activity, I've been making some sort of research on the roots of
jazz and funk. So, on the jazz side, I've been listening to the fundamentals of
Duke Ellington, Max Roach, Charles Mingus, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Dizzy
Gillespie, Roy Haynes, and others. On the funk side, Earth, Wind & Fire, Kool
and the Gang, Funkadelic, Parliament, and others. I'm really willing to buy the
Ken Burns' Jazz documentary DVD box. I've watched some episodes some time ago
and it's just amazing!
