Last night was valentine's day. So I and Carol watched two movies: [The Day
After Tomorrow](http://imdb.com/title/tt0319262/) and [The
Terminal](http://imdb.com/title/tt0362227/). The former is a movie from the
same director of Indenpence Day, so it's just boring! The second is more
interesting with a great Tom Hanks performance. Today we watched [Vanilla
Sky](http://imdb.com/title/tt0259711/), a interesting movie but the end was too
"didatic".

I'm very happy because [Glynn](http://www.gnome.org/~gman) invited me to
maintain [zenity](http://directory.fsf.org/zenity.html) module. Zenity is a
tool for displaying GTK+ dialog boxes from command line and shell scripts.

I've been very busy with the mastering readings.
[Aurelio](http://aurium.cjb.net) has just setup a [TWiki](http://www.twiki.org)
[Web](http://gnosislivre.org/twiki/bin/view/CulturaHacker) for my research
stuff. I hope to be putting all my work there...
