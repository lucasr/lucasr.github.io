Keeping a list of good first bugs for new contributors is a common practice in
some large open source projects. e.g. the Mozilla community marks these bugs
with "[good first
bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=sw%3A[good%20first%20bug];list_id=5155996)"
and the GNOME folks tag them with
"[gnome-love](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=keywords%3Agnome-love)"
in Bugzilla. The problem with these lists is that they tend to grow very
quickly and become overwhelming to go through­—which kind of kills their
original purpose of helping new contributors to find a task to get started.

I'd like to start a little experiment. What if we feature only one good first
bug every other week? Featured bugs will have an assigned mentor and some
initial overview of what has to be done. The effort to decide if you're up for
the task then gets much smaller, right? And if you don't have time to work on
the current featured bug, you can wait for the next one, no problem!

So, here we go: the first featured bug is bug
[774309](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774309), mentored by
[Brian Nicholson](http://thebnich.com/) (bnicholson). This bug is about adding
support for Android's voice search in Firefox. Brian has provided some [initial
code pointers](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774309#c8) in the
bug. Interested? Just add a comment to the bug to take it. I strongly recommend
joining us on IRC (irc.mozilla.org #mobile) to get some support on [setting up
your development
environment](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Android#Building_Fennec).
