Thanks to the nice work the [marketing
team](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeMarketing) has been doing, we now have a bunch
of [cool badges](http://www.gnome.org/friends/promote.html) to promote the
[Friends of GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/friends/) program! I've already added a
badge to [my blog](http://blogs.gnome.org/lucasr/) &#8211; and
[Stormy](http://www.stormyscorner.com/), [Glynn](http://blogs.gnome.org/gman/),
[Behdad](http://mces.blogspot.com/), [Jonh](http://www.bani.com.br/),
[Paul](http://www.silwenae.org/blog/), [Jaap](http://jaap.haitsma.org/),
[Andreas](http://www.andreasn.se/blog/), and many others too. What are you
waiting for? Go to our [Friends of GNOME promotion
page](http://www.gnome.org/friends/promote.html) and add one of our badges to
your website! Besides that, any help on spreading the word about the program is
more than welcome!

_We'll be probably posting something about the program status soon._
