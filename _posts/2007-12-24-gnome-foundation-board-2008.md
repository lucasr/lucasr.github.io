Now that the [final
results](http://foundation.gnome.org/vote/results.php?election_id=5) of the
GNOME Foundation's Board of Directors Elections were
[published](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2007-December/msg00093.html),
it's a good time to thank everyone who voted in me. I'm really surprised about
the number of votes I got! Be sure that I'll give my best.

I think we've got a very good team on Board and I'm very excited about our 2008
plans. We've already started to work on some really cool things!
