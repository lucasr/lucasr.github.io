I could [not attend](http://lucasr.org/2010/07/08/not-going-to-guadec/) GUADEC
last year for a very [good reason](http://lucasr.org/2010/03/01/julia/). So I'm
really happy that I'll be able to go to Berlin for the second [Desktop
Summit](http://desktopsummit.org) this year! This is my first GNOME conference
without holding any official roles in the project since 2007. This means I'll
hopefully have more time to just hang out with my fellow hackers. I'll arrive
on the 6th of August and leave on the 10th.

I guess it's a good time to announce that I'll be giving two talks this year.
The first one is about [GNOME development in JavaScript with
Gjs](https://desktopsummit.org/program/sessions/thoughts-gjs-based-development).
It will be on the 7th of August (Sunday) at 9h40 in the morning. Hopefully, a
few attendees will wake up earlier for this talk!

The [second talk](https://desktopsummit.org/program/sessions/introducing-board)
is about [The Board](https://live.gnome.org/TheBoardProject), one of my current
pet projects, which you have probably heard about. I'll demonstrate the current
features and talk about the future plans for the app. I hope to finish some
awesome new features in time for the conference. Let's see. This talk will be
on the 8th of August (Monday) at 14h40.

This is also my first open source conference as a
[Mozillian](http://lucasr.org/2011/06/14/joining-mozilla/). So, if you want to
know a bit more about Firefox Mobile, just find me at the conference venue for
a chat. All in all, I'm very excited about the conference this year! See you
all there!
