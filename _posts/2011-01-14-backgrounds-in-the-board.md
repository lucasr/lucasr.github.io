When I started writing [The Board](http://live.gnome.org/TheBoardProject), I
was quite pragmatic about the appearance of the app. I used my limited Gimp and
Inkscape skills to produce the UI theme images and grabbed some free background
images from internet.

So, the background images you've seen on previous The Board
[demos](http://vimeo.com/album/261244) are just placeholders. Christian Ankert
suggested—on the respective [bug
report](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=637705)— to use some of the
free stock images by [Kimberly
Crick](http://enchantedgal-stock.deviantart.com/). Great tip! I produced five
beautiful backgrounds based on her stock images:
[cork](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasrocha/5353802275/),
[cardboard](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasrocha/5354417080/),
[green](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasrocha/5354416980/),
[paper](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasrocha/5353802425/), and
[fabric](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasrocha/5353802329/). The goal with
those backgrounds is to reinforce the physical aspect of the UI. Hence the use
of textures mimicking real-world materials instead of abstract stuff.

The UI still needs some love from a real graphic designer but I'm quite happy
with this first set of backgrounds. If you want to propose new ones, please
[submit them](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=the-board) to
GNOME Bugzilla.
