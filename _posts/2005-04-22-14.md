Today is is the day I'll oficially become a bachelor on computing science at
[Federal University of Bahia](http://www.ufba.br). :-) I'll be the orator of
the cerimony. I wrote a [speech](http://coisa.im.ufba.br/~lucasr/discurso.html)
(in brazilian portuguese) about the role of technology for the cultural
diversity.

[Glynn](http://www.gnome.org/~gman/) cleaned some old zenity bugs from bugzilla
like the [line wrap](http://bugs.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=149290) issue and
[UTF-8 strings problem](http://bugs.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=150684). Cool!
