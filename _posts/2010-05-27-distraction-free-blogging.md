Following on my [online
uncluttering](http://lucasr.org/2010/05/09/uncluttering/) journey and very
inspired by existing distraction-free text editors
([WriteRoom](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom),
 [PyRoom](http://www.pyroom.org/features.html), and others), I decided to tweak
WordPress a bit so that I could have a better experience when writing my blog
posts. I had a couple of specific goals in mind.

## Only the necessary chrome

I just want to focus on what I'm writing. I only set tags, categories, tittle,
etc, once I've got something pretty much done content-wise. Also, I use a
very reduced set of controls most of the time: bold, italic, lists, and
images. So, anything else is pretty much just adding clutter to my editor. To
achieve that, I simply disabled all unused controls from WordPress' WYSIWYG
editor.

## No need to preview

I care a lot about how the content will look like when published. Because the
content style in the editor looked quite different than the actual blog design,
I used to click _Preview_ quite often and get a bit distracted while
writing. To be able to stay in the editor with no need to preview, I
basically made the editor style look exactly like the blog design. No
need to preview anymore.

The end result can be seen in the screenshot above. I used instructions from a
[couple](http://wpengineer.com/customize-wordpress-wysiwyg-editor/) of
[places](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/356730?replies=1) to do it. I'm
pretty happy with the end result.
