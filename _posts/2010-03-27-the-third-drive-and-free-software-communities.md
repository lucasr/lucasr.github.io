I ended up buying this book called [Drive by Daniel
Pink](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6452796-drive) while waiting for my
Dad to arrive in London at the Gatwick airport. It was the first time in a long
time that I bought a book almost randomly, without any wider background info,
reviews from other readers, etc. At first sight, it looked like one of
those lame books about motivation but that was not the case. Even though
the content of the book is not really new (to me, at least) the author has
the merit of a bringing a well-structured and organized discussion about
motivation in a way that it's easier for people with the
"carrots-and-sticks mindset" to understand the point of what really makes
people tick in modern world.

The book is about the new motivation framework (or "operating system" as the
author calls) that is getting increasingly stronger in today's society.
Instead of the usual rewards and punishments to keep people productive at work
(what the author calls Motivation 2.0), modern organizations are starting to
realize that what they actually need is to create an environment where people
can fulfill their intrinsic motivations (the "third drive&#8221;) through three
fundamental elements: Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose. The author calls that
Motivation 3.0.

As a person who's been involved in Free and Open Source SoftwareÂ (F/OSS) for a
long time, it was interesting to notice how those elements perfectly fit our
communities and why we've been so successful in many ways. F/OSS owes much of
its success to the dedication of autonomous contributors aiming to learn and
improve their skills inside a community that have a purposeful set of goals.
The fact that most people involved in our communities start as volunteers helps
a lot in this regard as the volunteer work gives maximum freedom on how, where,
and when to dedicate efforts, something that paid work usually lacks in a way
or another (with a few exceptions of course). Considering that F/OSS
communities seem to be getting increasingly more "professional" in the last
few years, with companies hiring a lot of the most relevant (previously
volunteer) contributors (see [the case of Linux for
example](http://apcmag.com/linux-now-75-corporate.htm)), I keep
wondering what will be the impact of this in the shape of our
communities in the long term. Nowadays, at least in the case of
GNOME, it's becoming more and more frequent to see new relevant
contributors being hired just after some time giving good
contributions. From my own experience, being paid to work on what you
used to do as a volunteer (or even being paid to do something
directly related to your contributions as a volunteer)
definitely has an impact on your motivation and how you and others
perceive your work inside the community. It's not necessarily a bad
impact but "something&#8221; surely changes. Luis has written [some
interesting
notes](http://tieguy.org/blog/2006/06/18/crowding-out-of-intrinsic-motivations-aka-the-bounty-problem/)
about this topic back in 2006 when the number of paid F/OSS
developers was probably smaller than today. I haven't formed a clear
opinion about this topic yet so I thought it would be useful to share
some of the questions I've been meditating about:

  * Are F/OSS communities slowly becoming just a way to showcase one's skills
  to be eventually hired by some nice F/OSS-friendly company? I've been
  contacted a few times by some guys asking how they could work inside a
  community to be eventually hired by a big company. This may sound silly but
  the fact that some people are seeing the F/OSS work this way is a sign of
  something I guess...
  * Does being hired to do F/OSS work actually destroy the intrinsic
  motivations of a previously volunteer contributor? How was your experience?
  * What are the main changes in a community composed mostly by paid
  developers? Dave has just conducted a GNOME census recently. I wonder what's
  the ratio between volunteer and paid developers in GNOME nowadays. My
  impression is that we still have a lot of volunteers but the people doing
  most of the heavy development are paid directly or indirectly to do the work.
  * What's the impact of having people doing volunteer work inside a community
  full of people being paid to do similar things. Is it bad for the motivation
  of our volunteers? I remember when I started contributing to GNOME 5 or 6
  years ago I got the impression that the paid developers were some sort of
  elite, the "chosen ", or something like this. That impression vanished at
  some point and didn't affect my motivation but I wonder how it affects
  others.

All in all, I'm personally a strong advocate of volunteer work inside F/OSS
communities. In my opinion, the healthiness and strength of a community should
be mainly measured by the number of volunteer contributors it has because those
are the people who are surely giving their contributions based on intrinsic
motivations. Passion, in other words.
