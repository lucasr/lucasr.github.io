It's been a long time I don't post anything. So, here are some stuff I've been
doing.

**Music**
  * Coltrane (dudes, this is REALLY good!)
  * Miles Davis (two great albuns: "Bitches Brew" and "Time After Time")
  * The Brand New Heavies (cool acid jazz)
  * James Taylor Quartet (one of the best acid jazz band)
  * Incognito (lots of groovie stuff)

After a short talk with kmaraas on IRC about GNOME and musician hackers, he
created the [GNOME Musician Index](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeMusicianIndex) at
l.g.o. GNOMusicians, add yourselves there, so, we can have a huge jam session
at GUADEC 7!

**GNOME**

The last development Zenity "Muqueca" release (2.11.92) before GNOME 2.12 is
out! Here are the news:

  * New and updated translations
      * Christian Rose [sv]
      * Zygimantas BeruÂ¿ka [lt]
      * Duarte Loreto [pt]
      * Kostas Papadimas [el]
      * Gabor Kelemen [hu]
      * Jordi Mallach [ca]
      * Mugurel Tudor [ro]
      * Maxim Dziumanenko [uk]
  * New documentation translations
      * Francisco Javier F. Serrador [es]
      * Maxim Dziumanenko [uk]

EOG was crashing when navigating through a directory with invalid images. [This
bug](http://bugs.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=311086) is solved now. :-)

**Mastering**

I've finished a [little
paper](https://gnosislivre.org/twiki/bin/view/CulturaHacker/ArtigoCibercultura2005)
(in portuguese) about Free Software and Ciberculture. INHO, this paper is not
good yet but the deadline forced me to release it.

**Google Talk**

Congratulations to Google for using jabber open protocol in [Google
Talk](http://www.google.com/talk). My account is lucasr.at.mundo gmail com.
Feel free to add me. :-)

**Movies**

  * Fantastic Four (horribleeee! crap!)
  * Before Sunrise (cool)
  * Sin City (great!)
  * Team America (good idea, no good content)
  * Million Dollar Baby (fantastic!)

**GNOME Desktop Workshop**

I gave a workshop on GNOME Desktop as part of [FACED's Free Software
Week](http://twiki.ufba.br/twiki/bin/view/RadioFACED/Programa%E7%E3oDaISemanaDeSoftwareLivreDaFaced).
I got very happy to see some teenagers from Alto das Pombas (a very poor place)
in the workshop.

I looked for some ready-made slides for this purpose but I didn't find any.
Maybe I'd be good to have "official" slides for GNOME Desktop workshops.
