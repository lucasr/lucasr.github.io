### More love to EOG

Some more [bug
cleaning](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?bug_id=314742,316004,307188).
It's good to see that we came from 108 to 90 bugs. Well, there are lots of bugs
to clean but I'm just happy to have some boring/critical bugs solved in EOG.

### Movies

  * [Monsters, Inc.](http://imdb.com/title/tt0198781/) — very funny!
  * [Out of Time](http://imdb.com/title/tt0313443/) — nice triller!

### Movements and communities

I gave a talk about some issues that I see as relevant about free software. One
of the key subjects was the important distinction between the free software
communities (the several
actors directly involved with the free software projects developement)
and the free software movements (social actors dedicated to spread the free
software philosophy, informing about its social, political and economical
relevance, deploying free software in the public sector and social projects and
so on). I argue that the communities are not necessarily always involved with
political free software activism, the movement. Here in Brazil (and I think in
other countries too), this is a very important distinction to be made
because it avoids wrong perpeptions like thinking that free software is just a
cause of a specific party or something with a homogeneous ideology set, which
is not true. Social actors with very diferent ideology sets support free
open-source sofware and hackers are quite heterogeneous when we talk about
social and political positioning (which is natural people from diferent
cultures and social contexts). There are marxists and companies like
IBM, Novell, Sun looking at the same "thing" with a great happiness
but with very diferent "eyes".
