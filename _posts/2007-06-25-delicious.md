I've [said bad things about the finnish
food](http://blogs.gnome.org/lucasr/2006/11/08/impressions/) before. Since I
moved to Finland, I've been experimenting several kinds of "native" food: from
hering to makkara, from reindeer to "new potatoes". My opinion about the food
hasn't changed too much. I still don't like it in general but I can live with
that now. :-P

However, there's one thing that you can only eat in Finland that is fucking
delicious: **the** **finnish strawberries**. It's one of the most wonderful
things I've ever eaten!
