My new year party was very cool at Jardim de Al√° beach with Carol, her brother
and parents. In this month, probably, I won't have any time for hacking because
I'm in the last graduation semester and I need to finish my [final
project](http://apephp.sf.net) (yes, there's no webpage yet, I'll solve it
soon!).

Some days ago, I watched the amazing movie [The
Incredibles](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317705/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0yMHxzZz0xfGxtPTIwMHx0dD1vbnxwbj0wfHE9aW5jcmVkaWJsZXN8aHRtbD0xfG5tPW9u;fc=1;ft=21;fm=1).
Great graphics and script!

I'm very curious about C# and Mono stuff. Maybe I'll begin to study something
about it as soon as i get some free time.
