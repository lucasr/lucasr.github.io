Very busy day. In the morning, a meeting to talk about free software adoption
by the Federal University of Bahia ([www.ufba.br](http://www.ufba.br)).

After, another meeting about a free software video that will be produced for an
important event at FACED ([www.faced.ufba.br](http://www.faced.ufba.br)).
I'll be the content director of this thing. I don't know what this
means but i think this role is cool. I never worked on video making. :-)

Then, in the afternoon, I integrated a Debian GNU/Linux workstation to the
University M$ Active Directory and worked on a nautilus view and VFS module to
manage apt packages with nautilus. It's based on James HenstridgeÂ´s
[rpmdb](http://www.jamesh.id.au/software/nautilus-rpm/).
