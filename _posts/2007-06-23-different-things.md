Last week...

  * **Acoustic guitar**: it's been a long time I don't play and sing. So, I
  thought it was a good time to come back to the music mood at home. _Baby
  don't worry about a thing... Every little thing is gonna be alright! Yeah!_
  * **Tennis equipment**: Carol and I had this weird idea of playing tennis. We
  this public tennis place close to our place and we thought it was a good
  oportunity to start playing. Roland Garros 2008, here we go!
  * **Sunglasses:** Carol and I have been looking for sunglasses for a long
  time. Coincidentaly, we found some good ones in a supermarket. Here's how I
  [look](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasrocha/590172888/). It seems to come
  from the 70's. :-P
