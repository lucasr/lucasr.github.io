As part of our [roadmap process](http://live.gnome.org/RoadMap/Process), we've
sent the roadmap information requests to all module maintainers/developers. If
you are a maintainer/developer of a GNOME official module and haven't received
the cited message, just let us know about which modules we've missed.

As usual, as soon as we have a first draft of the GNOME 2.22 roadmap, we'll
heat up some discussions in desktop-devel-list about this and the future stable
releases of GNOME in order to get feeback about the roadmap, discuss about
potential cross-module plans, and so on.

Fortunately, quite many modules have been proposed for GNOME 2.22 and some
interesting and challenging discussions have already started in
desktop-devel-list.

One of the major community goals for 2.22 is to have as many people as possible
reminding [Vincent Untz](http://www.vuntz.net/blog/) about his thesis! Go,
Vincent, Go! :-P
