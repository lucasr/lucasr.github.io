I'm just back from a well deserved 2-week vacation in Salvadorâ€”the city where I
was born and raised. While in Brazil, I managed to stay (mostly) offline. I
intentionally left all my gadgetry at home. No laptop, no tablet. Only an
old-ish smartphone with no data connection.

Offline breaks are very refreshing. They give you perspective. I feel we, from
tech circles, are always too distracted, too busy, too _close_ to these things.

Stepping back is important. Idle time is as important as productive time. The
world already has enough bullshit. Let's not make it worse.

Here's to a more thoughtful, mindful, and meaningful online experience for all
of us. Happy new year!
