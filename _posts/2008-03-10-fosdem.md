It's been more than 2 weeks since FOSDEM and I haven't written anything about
it...

As I [said](http://blogs.gnome.org/lucasr/2008/02/20/fosdem-and-i/) before,
this was my first FOSDEM. I have to say that it is a really nice FLOSS
conference. It's different than any other conference I've ever attended before
because it's very focused on communities and development.

I arrived on Friday morning with some other Nokians (Tommi, Marius, Daniel,
Johan, Lassi and Zeeshan). It was pretty nice to arrive early because
we had the whole day for some sightseeing in Brussels. Found
[Vincent](http://www.vuntz.net/blog) walking randomly in the city and we had
this nice chat about collaboration, communities, GNOME, Nokia,Â  roadmap, etc.
The beer event in the evening was fun but too packed.

I prefered to stay most of the time in the GNOME booth and because of that I
didn't see many talks. This was a nice way to meet a lot of new people and hang
out with some old GNOME fellows. The OLPC's XO brought a lot of curious people
to our booth. We sold quite many t-shirts and distributed a lot of promotion
materials. I saw [Ken'](http://blogs.gnome.org/kenvandine)s talk about [GNOME
Developer Kit](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeDeveloperKit) and
[Emmanuele](http://log.emmanuelebassi.net/)&#8216;s talk about
[Clutter](http://www.clutter-project.org/) talk. Both quite interesting. It's
very nice to see OH guys trying to bring the case of Clutter as an animation
framework for desktop applications. We need to explore this more. It seems that
Havoc has some [interesting ideas](http://log.ometer.com/2008-03.html) on this
regard (to be discussed during the GTK+ Hackfest this week). Unfortunately, I
missed Alp's WebKit talk. Vincent and I had this quick chat with Cornelius
Schumacher (from KDE e.V.) about possible paths for collaboration between GNOME
and KDE.

Thanks everyone who made my first FOSDEM a really nice experience! I took some
pictures, all of them are in this
