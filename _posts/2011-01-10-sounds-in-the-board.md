So, [The Board 0.1.0](http://lucasr.org/2010/12/23/the-board-0-1-0/) was
released a couple weeks ago with a good set of [initial
features](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2010-December/msg00051.html).
The 0.2.0 release will come with a couple of interesting new features. Here's
one of them: sound elements with voice recording capability.

At this point, it should be clear that [The
Board](http://live.gnome.org/TheBoardProject) is all about easily making daily
records in form of videos, photos, notes, and labels. The addition of sound
elements is natural step. Click on the image above to see a
[video](http://vimeo.com/18641257) demonstrating the new feature.

So far, voice recording in GNOME has been an obscure feature because the [sound
recorder](http://library.gnome.org/users/gnome-sound-recorder/stable/grecord-getting-started.html)
app is not easily accessible and it doesn't provide a convenient way to
organize and access your voice memos. The Board makes it extremely simple to
record voice memos. No need to care about saving files or anything. You can
easily label your tapes for later reference. Just add a sound element and start
recording!

The design still needs a bit more polishing of courseâ€”show playback and
recording time, improve tape animation, error messages, etc. Feedback is
welcome as usual. If you want to try this and other features, just follow the
instructions on the [hacking
page](http://live.gnome.org/TheBoardProject/Hacking) to get The Board built and
running on your system.

The next feature I'll be working on is actions on multiple elements. Operations
like removing multiple elements at once, aligning and distributing elements on
a page, stacking elements, etc. Some exciting stuff coming soon!
