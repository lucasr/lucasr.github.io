So, just after the [Kris](http://inverted-tree.livejournal.com/)' keynote
presenting the GTK+ 3.0 plans, we, your beloved release team, quickly presented
our proposed plan for GNOME 3.0. There are still lots of details to discuss but
the important thing is that our proposed mindset for 3.0 is in place for
discussion now. It involves a relatively smooth transition from 2.x to 3.x, a
more focused and inclusive development process, long-term development cycles,
and more. We hope to get some fruitful discussions during GUADEC and to
present the plan in a more structured and detailed way to everyone soon.
