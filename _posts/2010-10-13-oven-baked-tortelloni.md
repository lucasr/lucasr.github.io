    Oven-baked Tortelloni
  </p>
</div>

A couple years ago, Mariana, a very close friend, invited us for lunch at her
house. This was the first time I tried this tasty oven-baked
[tortelloni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortelloni) with mascarpone,
Greek-style yoghurt, and Parmesan cheese. We don't have it for lunch as often
as the [spaghetti with
salmon](http://lucasr.org/2010/04/11/our-favourite-sunday-recipe/) and the
[chicken with soy sauce](http://lucasr.org/2010/04/22/a-simple-lunch-recipe/)
but it's definitely in my top list. Here's what you'll need to serve 2 people:

  * 500g of fresh tortelloni
  * 125g of mascarpone cheese
  * 250ml of Greek-style yoghurt
  * 60g of grated Parmeggiano-Reggiano cheese
  * 2 garlic cloves
  * 1 spoon of olive oil

That's all! Very simple, right? So, How do you do it? Here are the steps:

  1. Boil water in a big sauce pan with the 2 garlic cloves and olive oil. This
     is the same water you're going to cook the tortelloni with.
  2. Once water boils, add the tortelloni, cook it for 2 minutes, and drain it.
     Business as usual. Leave the tortelloni in a medium glass roaster.
  3. Crush the now cooked garlic cloves into a bowl. Add the mascarpone and the
     yoghurt to the bowl and mix them thoroughly until they become a
     homogeneous cream.
  4. Spread the cheesy cream on top of the cooked tortelloni in the glass
     roaster.
  5. Pour grated Parmeggiano-Reggiano on top of everything.
  6. Put it in the oven (200°C) for about 15 minutes until the Parmesan looks
     toasted (see photo).

I use [fresh
tortelloni](http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/groceries/shopping/details/product_detail.jsp?bmUID=1286972444227&NEW_NAVIGATOR%3C%3Elevel_0_id=0&NEW_NAVIGATOR%3C%3Elevel_1_id=1&NEW_NAVIGATOR%3C%3Elevel_2_id=2534374310939561&NEW_NAVIGATOR%3C%3Elevel_3_id=2534374320021046&NEW_NAVIGATOR%3C%3Elevel_4_id=2534374320021048&NEW_NAVIGATOR%3C%3Elevel_5_id=2534374320021059&NEW_NAVIGATOR%3C%3Elevel_6_id=1689949371933555&GENERIC_EVENT%3C%3Egeneric_text_1=RESULT_SEARCH_CLICK&GENERIC_EVENT%3C%3Egeneric_text_2=tortelloni&GENERIC_EVENT%3C%3Egeneric_number_2=845524441801583&GENERIC_EVENT%3C%3Egeneric_text_3=tortelloni&bmForm=log_generic_event)
with garlic and herb filling. The cool thing about this fresh tortelloni is
that it only takes a couple minutes to cook — as I mentioned above. I prefer to
use fresh Parmeggiano-Reggiano and grate it myself instead of the usual grated
cheese packs because I can choose a better cheese and make it more chunky.

Voilà! The mix of the stuffed pasta with the cheesy cream with a touch of
garlic is delicious! Enjoy!
