The latest issue of the GNOME Journal has just been published. It features
insights into the role of end-users in the GNOME community, and an interview
with Emmanuele Bassi, gnome-utils maintainer and GTK+ developer. Writers in
this edition are Vincent Untz, and Lucas Rocha, respectively. [Read

Unfortunately this edition has only two articles. We from GJ hope to have more
writers for the next editions! Call for articles open for the august edition.
Get involved! :-)
