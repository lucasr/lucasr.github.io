Here we go! [Vincent](http://live.gnome.org/VincentUntz) and I have been
working on a roadmap process for GNOME. Well, here's the result:

<http://live.gnome.org/RoadMap/Process>

We expect the following benefits from the process:

  * Stimulate a roadmapping culture inside the community so that we discuss
  more often where we want to go (based on concrete plans);
  * Increase the awereness about the future steps of the project inside and
  outside the community;
  * Help with the release notes writing.

As
[announced](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/devel-announce-list/2007-March/msg00011.html)
in [d-a-l](http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/devel-announce-list), all
maintainers will receive a mail asking some questions about their plans for the
modules they're maintaining. Also, we're looking for more people to be part of
Roadmap Gang. So, if you're interested, contact us.

Hei Ho, Let's Go!
