I've received some emails from people interested in helping on EOG development.
EOG is a very nice project to start contributing (in the GNOME context) because
it's a simple and useful application. I've written the plans and related tasks
for Eog-Ng on this [wiki page](http://live.gnome.org/EyeOfGnome/EogNg).

> EOG is old in many senses: its code, its look. In the last two release cycles
> EOG received a lot of love and some very-wanted features were implemented.
> However, there's a need to rethink about the future of EOG in terms of its
> code (deep refactoring/recoding needed) and features. There are some design
> problems in the current code which are seriously affecting EOG's stability.
> Eog-Ng is a branch which aims to agregate all development work related to
> what we want from EOG from now on. **Eog-Ng** main goal is to maintain a very
> **solid and stable core** with the very basic feature of an image viewer but
> with support for some **extensibility**

**For everyone interested:** contributions are always welcome! Follow the
general instructions on Eog-Ng page, assign yourself to one or more tasks,
discuss the solution where applicable and hands on code!

Give some love to EOG today and have a better GNOME image viewer tomorrow!
Let's make EOG rock your world!
