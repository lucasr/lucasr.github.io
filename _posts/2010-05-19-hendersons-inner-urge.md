[Joe Henderson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Henderson) is one of my
favourite jazz saxophonists. He's has a very emotional, exploratory, and
intense sound. He played as a leader and sideman with great musicians such as
Herbie Hancock, Freddie Hubbard, Lee Morgan, Kenny Dorham, and many others; and
recorded for labels like Milestone and Blue Note.

As I [mentioned](http://lucasr.org/2010/05/11/hubbards-straight-life/) before,
the first time I heard Henderson playing was in Hubbard's _Straight Life_
album. After that, I ended up finding the album [Inner
Urge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Urge) while looking for some new
albums to buy at [Stockmann](http://www.stockmann.fi/portal/en/), in Helsinki.
I lost track of how many times I listened to this album after I bought it. I
think it was pretty much the only thing I listened to for at least a whole
month or so.

The sidemen: McCoy Tyner (piano), Elvin Jones (Drums), and Bob Cranshaw (Bass).
The first two were part of the amazing Coltrane quartet that recorded the
masterpiece album [A Love Supreme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Love_Supreme)
a few months later. Maybe for this reason, _Inner Urge_ has this sort of
Coltranean, deep, explorative atmosphere. Maybe this is why I love this album.

My favourite tracks are _Inner Urge_ and _El Barrio_. The former is a direct
reference to Coltrane sound. It's a mysterious melody, some serious stuff. The
latter is a Latin-influenced tune with a slow tempo — which brings a more
exploratory mood to the group. The album also has _Isotope_, which became one
of Henderson's classics. Special mention goes to Elvin Jones who's at his best
in this album with the complex, rich, imperfectly beautiful beats.
