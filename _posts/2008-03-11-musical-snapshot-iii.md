It's been a long time I don't bring a musical snapshot. Actually, it's been
more than 5 months since my last one. Wow. Because of that, it's kind of
difficult to summarize everything I've been listening to. My addiction to jazz
is getting stronger every day. I bought Ken Burns' Jazz documentary (quite
nice!). During my vacation in Brazil, I had the chance to buy quite
many albums from brazilian artists. I also tried some african and mexican
stuff. So, here it goes...

**Jazz**

Shit, the list is so long that I don't know where to start... Freddie Hubbard,
Miles Davis, Joe Henderson, John Coltrane, Art Blakey, Sonny Rollins,
Cannonball Adderley, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonius Monk, Max
Roach, Kenny Dorham, Ornette Coleman, Ron Carter, Herbie Hancock, Jaco
Pastorius, Wayne Shorter, ... I've listened to more than one album with
each of those guys. I have some special remarks though. Hubbard's _Straight
Life_ album is just amazing (featuring an all-star band with Hancock,
Henderson, Benson, Carter, and DeJohnette). I became a big fan of
Joe Henderson after listening to his _Inner Urge_ album &#8211; very
Coltrane-ish. He even has the same sidemen than in Coltrane's most famous
albums: McCoy Tyner and Mr. Elvin Jones. Sonny Rollins' _Saxophone
Colossus_ is a great album. I took some time to listen to Coltrane's _My
favourite things_ some more times (this one only loses to _A Love Supreme,_
my personal favourite jazz album). Ornette Coleman's _Tomorrow Is
the Question!_ is quite interesting too. Got the classic Savoy Live
Sessions of Charlie Parker, the roots of bebop (such Koko, Ornithology, and
so on). Here's the winners list:

  * Inner Urge (Joe Henderson)
  * Straight Life (Freddie Hubbard)
  * Red Clay (Freddie Hubbard)
  * Somethin' Else (Cannonball Adderley)
  * My Favourite Things (John Coltrane)
  * Complete Savoy Live Recordings (Charlie Parker)
  * Saxophone Colossus (Sonny Rollins)

**African**

I'm from the most african state in Brazil. African culture is simply part of
me. I listened a lot to two Richard Bona albums. Quite musical stuff. The
afrobeat of Femi Kuti is really nice.

  * Tiki (Richard Bona)
  * Reverence (Richard Bona)
  * Shoki Shoki (Femi Kuti)

**Mexican**

Federico was really kind and sent me some really cool initial references of
Mexical music. This is just the beginning of my research on the mexican world.

  * La Sandunga (Lila Downs)
  * De México y del mundo (Chavela Vargas)

**Brazilian**

During my vacation in Brazil, I had the opportunity to buy quite many albums
from brazilian artists. Got two new Mônica Salmaso's albums. I'm a big fan of
her. I finally managed to buy Max de Castro's _Samba Raro_. This is one of the
electronic music albums I've ever listened to. Really nice compositions, high
quality arrangements. The latest Djavan album _Matizes_ is quite boring.
Carlinhos Brown's _A gente ainda não sonhou_ is cool. Highlights:

  * Céu (Céu)
  * Iaiá (Mônica Salmaso)
  * Noites de gala, samba na rua (Mônica Salmaso)
  * Samba Raro (Max de Castro)
  * Nêga (Luciana Mello)
  * A gente ainda não sonhou (Carlinhos Brown)
