After, reading a lot about digital cameras, I've got a new camera today: a
Canon EOS 350D. Of course this nice camera doesn't make me a good photographer
at all (I really suck as a "photographer") but I'll give my best to improve
that with this new awesome toy. :-) Big thanks to
[Ross](http://burtonini.com/), [Hub](http://www.figuiere.net/hub/),
[Tiago](http://tiagovaz.wordpress.com/) and Tassia for the suggestions and
tips. Thanks to [tigert](http://tigert.org/) for telling me about that nice
camera store in Helsinki.
