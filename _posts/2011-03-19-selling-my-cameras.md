After some consideration I decided to simplify my photographer life and sell
both my DSLR and compact cameras to get one of those simpler yet fancy micro
four-thirds cameras. I haven't decided yet if I'll get a
[GF-2](http://www.dpreview.com/previews/panasonicdmcgf2/) or a
[E-PL2](http://www.dpreview.com/previews/olympusepl2/).

The reason is very simple: even though I have a pretty good DSLR camera, I
rarely use it because it's just too inconvenient to carry it around. It just
doesn't work well for casual photography—at least for me. The reason I bought a
compact was simply to have a decent HD video recorder. Anyway, here's what I'm
selling.

## Canon 50D with 2 lenses

This is a just over 1-year old body that came with a Canon 17-85mm kit lens.
I'm also including my 3-year old 50mm 1.8 lens and a 4GB compact flash. I guess
I don't have to say that this is an excellent DSLR camera, right? Price: £830

## Panasonic Lumix TZ7

This is a point-and-shoot camera with an impressive 12x zoom. Definitely one of
the [best
compacts](http://www.photographyblog.com/reviews/panasonic_lumix_dmc_tz7_review/)
I've ever used. Records 720p HD video with fairly good quality. I bought it
less than a year ago. Price: £100

Both cameras are in very good shape. No scratches or anything. If you're
interested in buying one of the cameras, please [contact
me](http://lucasr.org/about/). I'll give preference to buyers living in UK for
practical reasons.
