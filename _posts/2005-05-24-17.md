The new GNOME Planet design is great!

Reading Zygmunt Bauman's [Liquid
Modernity](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0745624103/ref=pd_sr_ec_ir_b/103-9774119-6584664?v=glance&s=books&st=*).
In fact, I began to read it a month ago but I had to stop because of the
post-graduation stuff.

I decided to invest my time to learn Python. It's a wonderful programming
language ("Oh! What a surprise, han?").

Unfortunatelly, I haven't had time to dedicate myself to the projects I'm
involved because of my mastering stuff.

We're 7 days from the sixth [FISL](http://fisl.softwarelivre.org) and I'm very
excited! I'll give a talk about [PEAR](http://pear.php.net).
