Unfortunately, I will not attend GUADEC this year. Not a good time to be out
for a week (or even a few days) as our little daughter is still demanding a lot
from us â€” especially from Carol because of the breastfeeding. Going to
GUADEC with family could be an option but we'll be going to Brazil for a
well-deserved vacation the week after the conference. Not a good timing.

I'm sure GUADEC will be especially awesome this year, full of interesting talks
and discussions about the upcoming GNOME 3 release. I'll miss the jam session,
the soccer match, the interesting chats about GNOME and life, the beer with
friends, etc. But I think staying home is the right thing to do this year.

One small wish: every year, some nice t-shirts are handed out at GUADEC from
the conference organizers, GNOME Foundation, sponsoring companies, etc. I would
love if someone could send me some of those t-shirts via post or through
someone coming to London after the conference. Size M please!

Have a nice GUADEC everyone!
