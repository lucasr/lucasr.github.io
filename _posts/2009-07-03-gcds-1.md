  * Arrived last night at Las Palmas, Gran Canaria. This city looks a lot like
  Salvador, my home city!
  * Dinner with Stormy, Jonathan, Zana, and Vincent at a nice Spanish (duh!)
    restaurant. I ate so much that I&#8217;m still feeling stuffed today!
  * Foundation Board meeting during the whole day today.
