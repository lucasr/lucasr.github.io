It's been a long time since I got so positively surprised about a restaurant.
Yesterday Carol and I had lunch at [Franco Manca](http://francomanca.co.uk), a
pizza place with branches in Brixton and Chiswick. This is now my favourite
pizza place in London! I heard about it from [Marco](http://marcopg.org/) and
ended up reading a few reviews in [Yelp](http://www.yelp.co.uk/).

Their pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough baked in a especial type of
wood-burning brick oven called _Tufae_. What does it mean in practice? The
dough alone is very tasty and light! For instance, we had garlic bread as
starter. The garlic bread is pretty much their baked sourdough with a simple
topping: a bit of tomato sauce, olive oil and chunks of garlic. Because the
dough is so good, they don't need a massive topping to make it tasty. Same
applies to the pizzas. Impressive.

The menu is very simple. They offer only 6 pizzas and around 5 starters. The
owners seem to be very strict about the ingredients they use in the pizzas. The
[cheese](http://francomanca.co.uk/cheese.html),
[meat](http://francomanca.co.uk/meat.html), and
[tomatoes](http://francomanca.co.uk/tomatoes.html) all come from trusted
organic suppliers. It's an affordable menu overall — if you compare with, say,
[Pizza Express](http://www.pizzaexpress.com/) — with pizza prices
ranging from £6 to £8.

In terms of drinks, they serve a delicious organic lemonade with honey! I
strongly recommend it! I also had a bottle of an Italian naturally-sparkling
water called Ferrarelle. Refreshing one. To make it all even better: their
espresso is made with [Monmouth](http://www.monmouthcoffee.co.uk/) coffee, my
favourite coffee shop in London!

I found some very good pizza places in London but none of them were
outstanding. Franco Manca is a simple and affordable restaurant serving the
best pizza in London in my opinion.
