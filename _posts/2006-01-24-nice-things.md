I haven't been posting for a long time. Well, lots of things happened since
Christmas. I'll try to post a summary of the nicest things here.

Christmas and New Year were REALLY great! I and Carol went to Arantina (a very
small town at [Minas Gerais](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minas_Gerais)
state). The town has a web [site](http://www.arantina.mg.gov.br/)! Wow!
There we met my loving family. It was wonderful to meet all my cousins, uncles
and aunts. I ate a LOT and got fatter (lucasr += 4kg).
[Here](http://public.fotki.com/libertarios/lucasr/arantina2005/) you can see
some photos.

I've got an ibook 12", 1ghz, 724mb RAM, 60gb HD from
[tiagovaz](http://www.advogato.org/person/tiagovaz/). Very nice! Installed
Breezy with no problems. Everything works just fine.

Carol, my wife, has just graduated in CS! Some people on IRC commented about
how wonderful is to be together with a woman who understands what you're doing.
Yes, it's really nice! :-) Some photos
