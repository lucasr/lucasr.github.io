    Miles Davis: Genius
  </p>
</div>

Even if you're not into jazz, you've probably listened to or heard of this
song. [So What](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_What_(composition)) is a [Miles
Davis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis) composition that was first
recorded as part of his world famous 1959 album [Kind of
Blue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kind_of_Blue) — probably the best-selling
jazz record of all time. Miles plays with his famous first great sextet: Bill
Evans and Wynton Kelly (piano), Jimmy Cobb (drums), Paul Chambers (bass), and
John Coltrane and "Cannonball" Adderley (Sax). With this amazing ensemble, the
original _So What_ version is, with no doubt, a masterpiece. Especial mention
to the soft and enigmatic piano and bass intro written by [Gil
Evans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Evans). It bothers me a bit that Miles,
Coltrane and Cannonball are a bit inconsistent among themselves in this
version. Miles sounds much more in the proper mood for the tune: less notes but
the right ones. Coltrane, on the other hand, is doing something else. He's just
doing his own thing — which is awesome but not really matching Miles' purpose
for the album. Cannonball is somewhere in the middle. All in all, _So What_
became a [standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_standard) and has been
recorded by several artists and with different arrangements and styles —
including different versions by Miles himself.

Among all versions of _So What_ that I had the chance to listen to, my
favourite one is the one recorded by Miles with a band very similar to his
second great quintet in an album called _Live At The 1963 Monterey Jazz
Festival_. Let me share why.

First of all, the personnel is amazing: Herbie Hancock (Piano), George Coleman
(Sax), Tony Williams (Drums), and Ron Carter (Bass). Definitely one of my
favourite Miles band. This album was recorded in 1963, a transition period for
Miles between the first and second great quintet (the only difference from the
second quintet is Coleman in place of Wayne Shorter). The sound of the
band is tight and furious. Their connection is amazing, it's like they can
predict what the others are about to play. It's one of the last Miles acoustic
bands. The second Miles quintet — which is well represented here — was focused
mostly on standards and bebop tunes. They kept reinventing old tunes. It was a
very inventive, creative, and genius group.

Secondly, this _So What_ version uses a _really_ fast tempo. That was another
important characteristic of Miles' bands of that period: they loved to
accelerate the tunes. Quoting Miles own words in his
[autobiography](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/829313.Miles):

> What was funny was this: the tunes that we used to record live that we played
> every night were just getting faster and faster., and after a while the speed
> really limited what we could do with them because they definitely couldn't
> get no faster than what they were.

The third reason I love this version is the performance of the rhythm section
(piano, bass, drums). When they start to play, you really wonder if they are
going to keep up the pace. Doing that famous bass riff in that speed in an
acoustic bass is quite challenging. But Carter does it sharply. The Williams'
drum beat is fucking awesome. The complex _bebopian_ beat and the random snare
and bass drums bombing really gets you. Last but not least, Hancock's use of
silence and space combined with unexpected harmony hints glues everything
together.

The last aspect is the solos by Miles, Coleman, and Hancock. Miles solo is the
first. The use of space is precise (and groovy). His solo if full high pitched
arpeggios. He sounds acid, aggressive, hot. It's the evil face of Miles. When
Coleman starts his solo you can hear him coming from the back of the stage
getting closer to the mic, bringing an informal atmosphere. His solo follows a
smoother approach. He does some really neat riffs, playing same notes with
different rhythms and articulations (intuitively followed by the rhythm
section). Hancock's solo is classic Herbie. Extremely melodic. You feel
like he's composing a tune on demand. Everything fits together like it was
planned. Nothing feels out of place.

the album.
