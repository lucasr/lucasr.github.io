Yesterday I played with Paroano Sai Milho at [Othon Palace Convention
Center](http://www.othon.com.br/port/palace/bahia/conve.htm) in a Ginecology
Conference. We had a lot of fun!

I need to focus on my graduation final project besause I have only 3 months to
finish implementation and write the dissertation.

In the afternoon, Me and [Carol](http://coisa.im.ufba.br/~caroline) looked,
once more, for an apartment with no success.

No time for hacking only for some bug triaging.
