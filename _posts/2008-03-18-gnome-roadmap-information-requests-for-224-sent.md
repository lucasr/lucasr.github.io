As part of our [roadmap process](http://live.gnome.org/RoadMap/Process), we've
sent the roadmap information requests to all module maintainers/developers. If
you are a maintainer/developer of a GNOME official module and haven't received
the cited message, just let us know about which modules we've missed.

As usual, as soon as we have a first draft of the GNOME 2.24 roadmap, we'll
heat up some discussions in
[desktop-devel-list](http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/desktop-devel-list)
about this and the future stable releases of GNOME in order to get feeback
about the roadmap, discuss about potential cross-module plans, and so on.

On [2.22](http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.22/), we've made
important changes in our Desktop and Platform. The [upcoming 2.24
release](http://live.gnome.org/TwoPointTwentythree) has an important role on
consolidating those changes and preparing the ground for pushing the project to
new directions. **Let's make it happen!**
