I'd love to see this mockup (by [tigert](http://www.tigert.com)) implemented in
GtkIconView. It would be a great improvement for Nautilus, EOG and all other
GtkIconView users. See bug
[#382544](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=382544). Actually, the
current selection visual feedback (selection border on label and "darkened"
icon) of GtkIconView is not good at all. So, it would be more than an
improvement. It would definitely be a bug fix.
