As you probably know, [Google](http://www.google.com) is organizing one more
edition of their [Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/) (GSoC)
program.

[GNOME](http://www.gnome.org) has
[participated](http://live.gnome.org/SummerOfCode) in all GSoC editions as a
mentoring organization with some nice results in terms of contributions and new
contributors. So, we want to participate this year too!

Our first **organization** **kickoff meeting** will happen on **March 6 at 18h
UTC** in the #soc-admin channel (irc.gnome.org). We're looking for volunteers
to help us to organize GNOME's participation in GSoC 2008. So, if you want to
help in any way, join us!
