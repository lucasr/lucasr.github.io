Once a cousin of mine who lived for 6 months in India told me that when you
move to a totally strange country, the most anoying thing is always something
you were not expecting. She was right! Before arriving to Finland, the most
scary thing for me seemed to be the weather. Well, considering that the lowest
temperature in Salvador (where I used to live in Brazil) I've ever gone through
was 15 degrees. So I thought I would suffer with the extremely cold finnish
weather. But then I arrived here, bought some warm clothes (coat, gloves,
scarf, shoes) and everything went fine (except when it's windy,
rainy/snowy and effing cold at the same time).

What is really anoying Carol and I is the food. Finnish food is horrible! _(Of
course not in absolute terms. This is just our impression based on our
cultural background. Well, I've heard from some finns that they don't
like finnish food either. So this is becoming more absolute!)_ The
general pattern is: cooked potatos with salad and "something else"
with a bizarre sauce. They put tuna in the pepperoni pizza! Shit! Also it's
very common to see people drinking [soured
milk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sour_milk) in the lunch _(I haven't tried
soured milk yet but I will. Some day I'll be drinking it too. Who knows?)_.

**Brazil@Finland**

Brazilians are like a virus. They're everywhere! I found out that there's a
quite big brazilian community in Finland. Carol and I started to make contact
with some brazilians living in Helsinki and Espoo. There are some brazilian
culture related places here too i.e samba and capoeira schools. In Finland, you
can find any kind of information about the cities in the Internet. We found
lots interesting cultural activities (music and movies mostly) in Helsinki and
Espoo. _(Cultural life in Helsinki region is cheaper than I expected by the
way.)_ Interesting to see how the e-territory makes life easier in the
territory.
