[GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/projects/soc) is participating in [Summer of Code
2007](http://code.google.com/soc). If you are a student and you want to apply,
you can [submit](http://code.google.com/soc/student_step1.html) your project
before **March 24th**. You can find some [ideas for
projects](http://live.gnome.org/SummerOfCode2007/Ideas) on our wiki.

If you want to help us on getting more student projects to GNOME, print the
[poster](http://live.gnome.org/SummerOfCode2007/Poster) in your language and
post it at universities of your city. Don't forget to notify in the [university
advertisement](http://live.gnome.org/SummerOfCode2007/UniversityAdvertisement)
page to avoid duplicate effort.

Maintainers, there's still time to add some ideas to the game. Just add it to
the &#8220;New/not-prioritized&#8221; section (see the instructions in the
page). I've seen some nice potential SoC projects on your plans for
2.20. :-)

Big thanks to [Máirín](http://people.redhat.com/duffy) for the beautiful banner
and poster!
