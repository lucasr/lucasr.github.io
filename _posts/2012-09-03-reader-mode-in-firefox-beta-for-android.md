Yes, Reader Mode is now available on Firefox Beta for Android! Go read my
previous [blog
post](http://lucasr.org/2012/06/21/reader-mode-in-firefox-mobile/) about it for
an overview of the feature. [Brian](http://thebnich.com/blog/) and I have been
working hard to get it in shape for the release and things are now much more
solid.

So, what's new since I announced Reader Mode? Besides tons of bug fixes, there
are two things I'd like to highlight. First, we went through a new design
iteration that adds a magazine style to the Reader, looks great! Secondly,
we've made some major performance improvements. Entering Reader Mode
is now instantaneousâ€”the way it should be. There some extra major
performance improvements and bug fixes to land in Beta soon by the
way.

You can help us make Reader Mode even better! It's simple: install [Firefox
Beta](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox_beta)
on your Android phone or tablet and use Reader Mode on your favourite news
sites, blogs, etc. Let us know if Reader Mode if offered as expected on
readable content (and _not_ offered on pages that are not really articles) and
if content is rendered as expected in Reader Mode.
[Report](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox%20for%20Android)
any issues you find.

I hope you love Reader Mode as much as we do. I can't wait to get it in the
hands of our users in Firefox 16!
