We're now in the middle of the [development cycle for GNOME
2.20](http://live.gnome.org/TwoPointNineteen) and our plans were already
published in our [RoadMap](http://live.gnome.org/RoadMap) page. Of course,
there are some very nice stuff coming for the next GNOME stable release as you
can see there.

I'd like to bring some attention to an important thing that can make a lot of
difference for GNOME next year. We have a very good **opportunity** to make
big, necessary and important changes in our desktop and platform in the 2.22
release. Why am I saying that?

From the [roadmap process](http://live.gnome.org/RoadMap/Process) we've kicked
off in the 2.20 development cycle, it's perfectly clear (to me) that several
important changes are coming (potentially for 2.22). Here are some of them:

  * _Revamped session management_: headed by [Dan
  Winship](http://live.gnome.org/DanWinship). Recently, a
  [branch](http://svn.gnome.org/svn/gnome-session/branches/new-gnome-session/)
  has been created with the new code.
  * _Next iteration_ _of the GNOME Configuration system_: headed by [Emanuelle
  Bassi](http://live.gnome.org/EmmanueleBassi). Possibly, an initial code will
  be shown and discussion on this topic will happen at GUADEC.
  * _Revamped VFS API_: it's called GFVS and is being headed by [Alex
  Larsson](http://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/). Current code resides on a [git
  repo](http://www.gnome.org/~alexl/git/gvfs.git). For a good overview on GVFS,
  read this
  [message](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-devel-list/2007-February/msg00062.html)
  Alex to gtk-devel-list some time ago. Current status and discussion will be
  take place at GUADEC.
  * _New documentation technologies_: it's called Mallard and is being headed
  by [Shaun McCance](http://live.gnome.org/ShaunMcCance) and [Don
  Scorgie](http://live.gnome.org/DonScorgie). Current code resides
  [here](http://svn.gnome.org/svn/gnome-doc-utils/trunk/sandbox/mallard/)
  (Mallard) and [here](http://code.google.com/p/rarian/) (Rarian, replacement
  for scrollkeeper). We have 2 [Summer of
  Code](http://live.gnome.org/SummerOfCode2007) projects for the development of
  a documentation editor for GNOME which uses the new infrastructure. Some of
  the new stuff will probably be used in 2.20 already. Talks about related
  topics at GUADEC.
  * _New applets API_: developed by [Ryan
  Lortie](http://live.gnome.org/RyanLortie). Current code resides on git repo
  (I don't remember where it is). Talk and discussions on this topic will
  happen at GUADEC.

There are others: GTK+ additions and more widgets consolidation ([Project
Ridley](http://live.gnome.org/ProjectRidley)), [SoC
projects](http://live.gnome.org/SummerOfCode2007/AcceptedProposals) (some of
them could possibly land in GNOME 2.22), Bugzilla 3.0, and so on. Also, there
are some important topics which needs to be seriouly and objectively discussed
like web services integration, better desktop integration with instance
messenging and voip, search engines and metadata, and others. A combination of
effort, time, manpower, good communication and community cohesion will decide
if those goals will be achieved or not.

Let's keep those goals in mind for 2.22 and try to stay focused as much as
possible so that we can make them a reality. GUADEC will be a wonderful time to
discuss those topics.

**GNOME 2.20 will rock a lot! Let's make 2.22 a 2<sup>3</sup> release!**
