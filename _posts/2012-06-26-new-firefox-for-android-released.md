Finally! It's been 8 months of hard work from an amazing team! I've
[written](http://lucasr.org/2012/05/21/native-firefox-for-android-beta/) about
the new Firefox for Android before when we entered Beta stage. Yes, it's whole
different beast than any previous version: it starts instantaneously, uses much
less memory, renders pages much faster, panning and zooming are super smooth,
and features a brand new UI.

And this is just the beginning! There's a lot of stuff coming very soon in the
next releases: new tablet UI, new tabs pane, text selection, find in page,
Android bookmarks/history import, search suggestions, [reader
mode](http://lucasr.org/2012/06/21/reader-mode-in-firefox-mobile/), tons
of bug fixes, and much more. If you're feeling adventurous and can't wait
to try the upcoming features, you can see them in action in the
[Nightly](http://nightly.mozilla.org/) build.

I couldn't be more proud for being part of this team! You can download the [new
Firefox for
Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox)
now. Trust me, you'll find many reasons to love it.
