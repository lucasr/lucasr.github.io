After three years at [litl](http://litl.com), it's time for me to move on.
Writing a blog post to announce that you're leaving is always a bit tricky. In
this case, it's because the experience at litl was so rich in so many ways that
to it's hard to know where start from.

Back in the beginning of 2008, I had already decided to
[leave](http://lucasr.org/2008/03/19/leaving-nokia/) the
[Maemo](http://maemo.org/) team at Nokia and started looking for my next gig. I
heard about litl for the first time from OpenedHand's
[Matthew](http://twitter.com/mallum). He said [Havoc](http://ometer.com/) was
working on something pretty cool there. I had started conversations with a
couple of prospective employers but I thought it would be cool to talk to Havoc
and get to know a bit more about the company's plans anyway. I honestly thought
it was very unlikely that litl would be my next thing mostly because I was
under the impression that they were only hiring in the US.

Fast forward several weeks, I accepted an offer and started working at litl—a
few months in Helsinki waiting for my UK work permit then finally in London.
And I was not alone, the whole Maemo UI framework and toolkit teams—Tommi, Xan,
Johan and I—got hired at the same time! Interestingly, this was not a
collective move in any way. We only found out about each other's interest
in litl once we started having our first interviews. It was funny to see
the rumors that were founding a Maemo-focused company of some sort.

The first two years at litl were quite intense! Each of us would be working on
something totally different each week or month—cache management, webcam, photo
app, contacts app, sync protocol, web browser, core UI, plugin framework, etc.
All this while we were still trying to finalize the design and interaction
model for the product. We finally released the [litl
webbook](http://litl.com/meet-webbook/overview.htm), our
[cloud-based](http://lucasr.org/2009/11/04/litl-webbook-some-technical-comments/)
computer, in November 2009. This is, by the way, long before Google actually
released Chrome OS.

litl's team is just awesome, full of extremely talented and generous
people—quite a few of them are well-known for their contributions to GNOME and
other F/OSS projects. Throughout those years, the team gradually grew on all
fronts with people coming from Amazon, Novell, Red Hat, OLPC, US startups, and
many others.

I'd like to make a special mention of a few people with whom a worked more
closely since I joined. First of all, it was a great pleasure to work with
Johan B. and [Tommi](http://blogs.gnome.org/tko/) for almost 5 years, both at
Nokia and litl. I learnt _a lot_ with them. Secondly, working with Havoc was an
awesome experience. He has this huge talent for solving complex problems
besides being simply a nice guy. Last but not least, I loved working with
[Marco](http://marcopg.org/). He is, with no doubt, one of the most passionate
developers I've ever met.

A lot has changed in the company since the release of webbook. litl is now
starting to explore new areas and markets. I feel that I have now ended an
important career cycle and it's time to move on to something new. All in all, I
can only thank everyone at litl for the great time I had!

What I'll be doing next? I guess that's a topic for my next post :-)
