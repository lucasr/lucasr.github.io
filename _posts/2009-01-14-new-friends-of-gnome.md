We have just released the new [Friends of GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/friends)
website! It's not only a new website, we now have:

  * Much more clear presentation of the program which we hope will help us on
  getting more donors;
  * "Adopt a Hacker" option, which allows you to subscribe for a monthly $10
  donation;
  * New gifts for donors: mugs, t-shirts, postcards, stickers, etc;

Big thanks to:

  * Stormy, who's responsible for the whole new presentation of the program;
  * Zana, who's the program admin, handling the relationship with donors and
  all the daily tasks surrounding Friends of GNOME;
  * Andreas and Kalle, for the new website design;
  * Owen, for the help on setting up the new website in the GNOME servers;
  * GNOME marketing folks, who helped us with feedback and ideas;
  * Everyone else who made this happen!

If you have any issues, suggestions, ideas about the new website, email us
(fundraising at gnome.org).

**So, what are you waiting for!? Go and [Adopt a
Hacker](http://www.gnome.org/friends) today!**
