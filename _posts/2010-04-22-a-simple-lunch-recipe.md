    Chicken with soy sauce

Now that I've shared one of our [favourite Sunday lunch
recipes](http://www.lucasr.org/2010/04/11/our-favourite-sunday-recipe/), I
thought it would be nice to share one of our basic lunch recipes: chicken with
soy sauce. We've been having this dish for lunch once a week (at least) because
it's very tasty and quite easy to prepare &#8211; good for parents with a
new-born baby, by the way. Here's what you'll need to serve 2 people:

  * 500g of chicken breast fillets
  * 300ml of double cream
  * 100ml of soy sauce (approximately, see steps 1 and 4)
  * Half chopped onion

And now the step-by-step instructions:

  1. Put the chicken fillets in a bowl and soak them in soy sauce. Leave it for
     about one hour. The fillets will get _very_ soft!Â You don't need to add
     salt or any other spice to the fillets because the saltiness from soy
     sauce is definitely enough.
  2. Cook the fillets as usual in a frying pan. Don't add the soy sauce excess
     from the bowl just yet. The frying pan must be large enough to contain the
     fillets and sauce (see step 4).
  3. After a few minutes cooking the fillets, put the chopped onion in the
     frying pan to cook it with the chicken.
  4. Once fillets are cooked, add the double cream and the excess of soy sauce
     from the bowl. You can control the saltiness of the sauce by adding more
     or less soy sauce. The sauce will look brownish (see photo).

The chopped onion is sort of optional. We often prepare this dish without it
when we don't feel like chopping onion (or when we don't have any). We have
this dish with plain rice (see photo) but other combinations are possible I
guess.

Let me know if you decide to try this recipe and if you enjoyed it. Bom
apetite!
