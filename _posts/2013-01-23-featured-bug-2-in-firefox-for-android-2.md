Before bringing up the next [featured
bug](http://lucasr.org/2012/12/07/featured-bug-1-in-firefox-for-android/), it's
probably a good time for a quick update on the state of Firefox for Android's
coding community. Long story short: we have never had as many coding
contributors as we have now! Here's what some of them have been working on.

Sriram Raghuraman implemented a "set wallpaper" context menu option for images
in web content. Greg Roodt added mouse wheel scrolling support. Mark Capella
fixed a handful of bugs in different parts of our UI. Alex Nagacevschi
implemented preliminary support for RTL content in Reader Mode. Ian Patterson
fixed some weirdness in how downloaded images are named. Ravisankar
Sivasubramaniam fixed  a bug on our input handling when switching tabs. And the
[list
continues](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=FIXED%20sw%3Amentor%20prod%3Aandroid;list_id=5446532)!

Want to have your name on this list? Here you go: [bug
807990](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=807990) is our second
featured bug. It's about a small but very useful feature in Reader Mode: adding
a double-tap gesture to scroll the article a "screenful" distance. You'll be
mentored by yours truly. I've just added some background information to the bug
report to get you started. Comment on the bug to take it!

I strongly recommend joining us on IRC (irc.mozilla.org #mobile) to get some
support on [setting up your development
environment](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Android#Building_Fennec).
