Being the (mild) technophile that I am, getting a new gadget is a special
moment. I usually do quite a lot of research, compare loads of competing
products, and read a bunch of reviews from different sources before reaching
the point of actually purchasing a new gadget. At the moment I receive the
shiny new package, I expect an ideal first boot experience comprising no more
than 3 steps:

  1. Unbox
  2. Connect
  3. Enjoy

The "Connect" step might be either cable connection and/or network connection.
Unfortunately, the first boot experience of many gadgets don't follow this
simple 3-step process. Some add more steps, others simply offer a lame first
time experience. Here are some of the common mistakes.

**Battery.** Your new gadget has just arrived. You want to start playing with
it as soon as possible, of course. You try to switch it on but nothing happens.
You realize that you first need to charge your gadget. Epic. Fail. If your
product runs on battery, it should be at least partially charged to be ready to
use just after unboxing. Apparently, this a common mistake on mobile phones.

**Connection.** You unbox your new gadget, plugs it to power source, but then
you realize you don't have the cable to connect the gadget to your TV, or your
laptop, or whatever. Uh-oh. Products should come with all necessary equipment
for optimal experience. My current printer didn't come with the necessary USB
cable and my PlayStation 3 came with no HDMI cable. Very frustrating. Oh, and
I've heard that the iPhone 4 doesn't come with the bumper for optimal signal
performance... Ok, never mind.

**Defaults.** The default layout, settings, and content on the gadget should
give a strong clue on how cool the features are. Default settings should feel
right. For example, if there's a weather feature, it should show the weather
for the user's current location by default. You should be able to play with all
features with default content or through a minimum setup. RSS reader should
have a few in interesting feeds by default. A microblogging widget should have
an über simple way to get started.

The underlying message from the defaults should be something like "Here's how
cool this device is, now it's your turn, make it yours". Galaxy S gets defaults
totally wrong. It comes with 7 home screens (!?), either empty or with widgets
using lame default content.

I'm pretty sure this list is much longer than that. Those mistakes might seem
obvious but they still happen very often. The goal of any first boot experience
should be to reduce the process between unboxing and enjoying the product to a
minimum and engaging users from very first second they start using the
device—with sane and compelling defaults.

The more the product requires just to get started, the more reasons you're
giving users to get frustrated. First impressions matter. A lot.
