Carol and I watched a movie called [Taking
Lives](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364045/) with Angelina Jolie, Ethan Hawke,
Kiefer Sutherland and others. Not great, just cool. In fact, most of the
american movies I've seen were just cool or worse. They seem to be all
the same! There are exceptions of course! :-)

I'll begin to write an article called "The Ciber-sociality in free
software development communities" as part of my mastering research.
Sociality (I don't know if this english translation fits) is a
[Maffesoli](http://www.ceaq-sorbonne.org/maffesoli/) sociological concept to
define the new tribal, hedonist and vitalist social aggregation form that
arrises in the post-modernist society. The empirical reference for this article
will be the GNOME community. So, I hope you all help me with some
semi-structured interviews on IRC or e-mail.
