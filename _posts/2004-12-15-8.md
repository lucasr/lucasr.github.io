Carol and I, FINALLY, found a apartment! Soon I'll be taking some pictures of
it. It's small but very cool. We did a party to receive some gifts from family
and friends and it was very funny.
[Here](http://public.fotki.com/libertarios/vinnie/cha_de_cozinha_/) you can see
some photos. It has been very nice to have a daily life with Carol beside me.

In the last days I started to work on an APT Cache nautilus view. There are a
lot of changes in Nautilus for views because Bonodo if being removed because of
performance issues. Jamesh talks about it with more details in his

some troubles in using the libapt-pkg API but I hope I solve them soon.

I've ported [zenity](http://directory.fsf.org/gui/other/zenity.html) to use the
