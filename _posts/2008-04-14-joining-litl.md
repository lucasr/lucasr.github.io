It's time to tell where I'm going. I'm sure this is not a surprise anymore to
many :-)

I'm joining [Havoc](http://log.ometer.com)'s team at
[litl](http://www.litl.com) to work on a very exciting project.

Unfortunately,Â I can't tell anything about the project for now _(actually, I
think it will take some time until we can say anything)_. But yes, it's
GNOME-related and involves the development of a consumer product comprising
hardware, software, and online services.

I'll stay in Finland until June doing remote work and then move to London to
work on a litl office there.

Woohoo!
