It's been some time that I've kept my work on the GNOME [release
team](https://live.gnome.org/ReleasePlanning) to a minimum by just doing a few
development releases. After some consideration, I decided that it's a good time
to leave. The awesome [Colin Walters](http://blog.verbum.org/) will replace me.

This is the team that set the [general
plan](https://live.gnome.org/ThreePointZero/Plan) for the GNOME 3 release and I
feel very proud of having been part of it. I especially remember a couple of
very long conversations with my [evil twin](http://www.vuntz.net/journal/)
about GNOME 3 and the team discussions during our meetings at GUADEC and
FOSDEM...

Leaving the release team means that I now have no official roles in GNOME
anymore. I've [left](http://lucasr.org/2010/02/17/resigning-from-the-board/) [a
few](http://lucasr.org/2011/03/03/new-planet-editor/)
[other](http://lucasr.org/2010/05/25/new-zenity-maintainers/)
[positions](http://lucasr.org/2010/02/06/new-eog-maintainers/) recently—among
[others](https://live.gnome.org/LucasRocha) that I haven't really announced.
This is actually an explicit decision of mine to gradually free some of my
(rare) spare time for other personal projects. You probably know [one of
them](https://live.gnome.org/TheBoardProject). But there's probably more
coming, stay tuned!
