As officially announced during the [GNOME Foundation
AGM](http://guadec.org/schedule/meetings) and in
[foundation-announce](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2007-July/msg00035.html)
by Glynn, I'll replace [Dave](http://blogs.gnome.org/bolsh) in the [GNOME
Foundation Board](http://foundation.gnome.org/about/).

It's a big honnor to replace Dave. I hope I can do at least half of what he did
for the Foundation. Dave, I wish you the best in your future steps!

Thanks for the board members for trusting me this position and everyone for the
kind words!
