Yesterday, i watch two great movies: [21 Grams](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0315733/)
and [The Magdalene Sisters](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318411/). The former
brings interesting thoughts about life and human relationships. The second is a
real history about three irish women that are forced to live in convent to
correct their "sinful" behavior. Paralelly, it brings a picture of the 60's
Irish society.

**Reading:** [Culture and Technology](
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0333929292/qid=1113569053/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-4764157-4290517)
(Murphie and Potts). Interesting analysis of the mutual and dynamic relation
among society, culture and technique mainly from the viewpoint of the media
technologies.
