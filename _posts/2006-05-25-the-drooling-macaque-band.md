Do you want to make history at GUADEC? Want to appear in the most cool showbiz
magazine's as a popstar? Then you need to join **The Drooling Macaque Band**!

For now, we have a drummer (me), sax (davyd) and guitar (garnacho) players. Of
course the idea is to have an open spage for a jam session but we need to have
a core group with a predefined repertory. We're "hiring" bass and keyboard
players and one or more singers (for non-instrumental songs).

We probably won't have time for a rehearsal at Villanova. We need to work on
the repertory before GUADEC so that we can listen and practice the songs on
time.

I added the band organization stuff at the [GNOME Musician
Index](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeMusicianIndex) page.
