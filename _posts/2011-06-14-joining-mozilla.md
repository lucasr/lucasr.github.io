I'm really excited to announce that I'm joining the
[Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.com/) folks to work on [Firefox
Mobile](http://www.mozilla.com/mobile/)! There are several reasons why I'm
excited about it, here are a few of them.

## Big Challenges

All major mobile platforms have their own built-in web browser. Being a
third-party browser in the mobile space means that you have to offer an
extremely compelling product in order to convince users to switch. And I do
believe Mozilla can make it happen. Allowing users to seamlessly go from
desktop to mobile without interruption is a major step on the right direction.
I'm sure more compelling features will come out.

## Space for innovation

The web browsing experience on mobile devices carries much less legacy than on
desktop. This means there are less barriers and constraints for innovation and
a lot of space for experimentation. For instance, tablets bring a whole world
of possibilities in terms of new features and interaction models for larger
touchscreens.

## Public benefit, Open source

It feels good to work for a public benefit organization that is fully committed
to improving the web. Mozilla is also a huge open source community. I'm sure it
will be a great opportunity to meet new people and make new friends. As a
long-time open source contributor, I'm eager to learn more about the Mozilla
community and hopefully be able to contribute in a meaningful way.

My first day at Mozilla will only be in July as I want to take a well-deserved
break between jobs to clear my head a bit before starting. It will be good to
spend more time with my girls, travel a bit, and maybe work on some of my pet
projects.

Exciting times ahead!
