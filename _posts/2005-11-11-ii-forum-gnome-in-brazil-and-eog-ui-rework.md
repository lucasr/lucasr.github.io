**II Fórum GNOME**

 alt="" align="left" />I'll attend [II Forum
 GNOME](http://www.forumgnome.com.br) this year. It's the first event I attend
 as a GNOME dev, this is nice. I'll give a talk about GNOME Desktop present and
 future. Probably I'll talk about the current desktop features, perfomance
 efforts, potential new modules and some other interesting stuff that some
 other GNOME hacker suggests. :-)

Tim Ney, Germán Póo Caamaño, and Sandino Flores will be there too. It'll be
nice to meet other GNOME people. Actually, I never personally met anyone from
GNOME. I think the Forum could have more hacking activities. There are just a
few people here in Brazil directly involved with GNOME development. We need to
get more brazilian contributors through hacklabs and workshops. Another problem
is that no one here knows about the event. A serious communication problem.

**EOG UI Rework**
  
Well, I started the EOG UI rework that is part of our plans for 2.14. I didn't
finish it yet but here is a screenshot (with one of the awesome [Garrett
LeSage's](http://linuxart.com/log) photos):

I'm thinking about moving the Image Information side pane to a separate dialog.
The current side pane takes too much space and there are too many EXIF data to
show in a litle space. This dialog would have an image thumbnail, the EXIF data
and next/prev/close buttons for easy navigation through images. I know dialogs
sucks but the current approach is ugly. Discussion about this issue is taking
place [here](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=313676). Comments?
