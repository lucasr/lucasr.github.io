We've sent the roadmap information requests to all module maintainers. If you
are a maintainer/developer of a GNOME module and haven't received this message,
feel free to just follow the instructions described
[here](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/devel-announce-list/2007-April/msg00004.html)
(and let us know we missed you and/or your module).

As soon as we (The Roadmap Gang) have a first draft of the GNOME 2.20 roadmap,
we'll heat up some discussions in
[desktop-devel-list](http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/desktop-devel-list)
about this and the future stable releases of GNOME in order to get feeback
about the roadmap, discuss about potential cross-module plans, and so on.
