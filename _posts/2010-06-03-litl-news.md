Last time I
[blogged](http://lucasr.org/2009/11/04/litl-webbook-some-technical-comments/)
about [litl](http://litl.com/) was back in November last year, when we released
our first ever product: the [litl
webbook](http://litl.com/easy-to-use/intuitive-interface.htm). I thought it
would be a good time to post some news, now that we've
[announced](http://litl.com/everything-else/press-release.htm?id=588985) our
next product: a Web-connected TV box with an awesome remote — see the news
on [Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/13/litl-working-on-a-settop-box-with-smartphone-like-remote-not-sc/),
[Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/5538401/a-litl-box-wants-to-turn-your-tv-into-an-actually-good-web-browser),
[Fast
Company](http://www.fastcompany.com/1646754/litl-will-release-tv-internet-product-webbook),
and others for more information and photos.

Since the launch of the webbook, we've done a few releases of the litl OS — the
software running in our products — with major improvements in existing
features, new features, and important bug fixes. Those updates were
automatically downloaded and installed on all webbooks through all neat update
system. Let me highlight some of those.

**Mediawall major improvements.** Mediawall is litl's signature channel that
aggregates photos and videos from several online services and show them in a
nice timeline. We spent a couple months [improving
Mediawall](http://blog.litl.com/2010/03/03/getting-better-all-the-time/) by
refining the user experience, redesigning and simplifying the timeline view,
improving video playback stability, making some important performance
improvements, and fixing a lot of bugs. Getting the Mediawall user
experience right is quite challenging as its implementation involves a
tight integration between the litl OS and our server side bits.

**Photo & Video upload.** One common comment from users and reviewers of the
litl webbook was that even though the product allowed you to view photos and
videos from several online services, it didn't support media upload. A few
months after the release, we added super-simple [upload
support](http://blog.litl.com/2010/04/21/uploading-made-easy-with-litl/) to the
litl OS. Users can upload photos and videos to Flickr, Picasa, SmugMug, and
Shutterfly from the webbook by just following the very simple process of
plugging your camera in, selecting the online service to upload your media to,
and starting the upload. The new content appears in Mediawall after
just a few minutes.

**More services in Mediawall.** By the time we launched the webbook, Mediawall
supported photos and videos from Flickr and Shutterfly. On a later release, we
[added support](http://blog.litl.com/2010/03/03/getting-better-all-the-time/)
for Picasa and SmugMug. More services will be gradually added in the future.

**Chromium-based web browser.** The latest litl OS release features a
re-implementation of our web browser's guts based on
[Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/Home) — instead of Mozilla's Gecko. That
doesn't mean that [gjs](http://live.gnome.org/Gjs) is now based on V8 engine or
anything. The main UI shell is still running on
[Spidermonkey](http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/) engine. The new
Chromium-based browser allowed us to have more control over the life cycle and
resource usage of the browser cards and we now have a much smoother and
integrated web browsing experience.

**New channels.** Several [channels](http://devblog.litl.com/?p=14) have been
added to our Card
Catalog. [Facebook](http://blog.litl.com/2009/12/03/introducing-the-new-facebook-status-channel/), [BakeSpace](http://blog.litl.com/2010/02/23/perfect-in-the-kitchen/),
and [NPR](http://blog.litl.com/2010/03/09/listen-up-npr-fans/) are some of the
cool channels we've released since launch. The first ever [litl
SDK](http://blog.litl.com/2010/03/23/litl-webbook-with-big-news/) has been
announced a couple weeks ago. We hope this will boost the development of new
channels for the litl products from now on.

**Misc improvements.** Besides the big features above, a lot has been done on
several parts of the OS: Card Catalog now has a much nicer UI, news channels
are much cleaner and stable, remote BIOS update proceduce, overall UI
performance has been improved, faster [full-screen video
performance](http://blog.litl.com/2009/12/22/a-litl-faster/), initial browser
page has been simplified and enhanced, battery status is now visible in the
Settings card, and much more.

I worked on three of those areas: Mediawall, Photo & Video upload, and some of
the Misc improvements. We have already started working of some major new
features for the litl OS which will be released with our next product. Expect
some exciting news from us! For those interested in the webbook, we have
recently reduced its [price](http://store.litl.com/) from $699 to $399. Enjoy!
