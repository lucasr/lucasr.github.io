So, I just arrived in Boston. When I got to the hotel, my room was not ready
yet so I had to randomly walk around the city for about 1 hour. I was quite
tired but it was a nice walk after all. I found this nice
[bookstore](http://tridentbookscafe.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp) where I bought
two books I was looking for with very good prices: the biographies of
[Coltrane](http://www.amazon.com/Coltrane-Story-Sound-Ben-Ratliff/dp/0374126062)
(by Ratliff) and [Davis](http://www.amazon.com/Miles-Davis/dp/0671725823) (by
Davis). I'm reading now the biography of [Jimi
Hendrix](http://www.amazon.com/Room-Full-Mirrors-Biography-Hendrix/dp/1401300286)
(by Cross). Cool stuff.

Anyway, if you're around and want to have dinner/a beer this week, just let me
know.
