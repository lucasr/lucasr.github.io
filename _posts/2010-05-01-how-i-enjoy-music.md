Yes, I&#8217;m an avid music fan. I&#8217;ve learnt to love music since I was a little kid seeing my Dad playing Brazilian music ([Forró](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forr%C3%B3), [Chorinho](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorinho), [Samba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba), [Bossa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bossa_Nova), [Jovem Guarda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jovem_Guarda), and others) every week in a bar/restaurant in our neighbourhood in [Salvador](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador,_Bahia). Since then, I&#8217;ve been the singer of a garage rock band called _Precários_ (during my teenage years), percussionist and drummer in [a](http://www.myspace.com/leonardoda20) [few](http://www.myspace.com/somdoliborio) [bands](http://paroano.com.br/) until 2006, and listened to a quite diverse range of genres. Here are some quick facts about my music habits which roughly describe how I enjoy music nowadays.

**I listen to Jazz most of the time.** [Neo-soul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-soul), [Acid Jazz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_jazz), and [Brazilian music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_music) comes next in my daily playlist &#8211; intertwined with the new stuff I end up finding on the way. I&#8217;m not really a mainstream guy and usually like more niche stuff. But I can enjoy some mainstream things too. A side note: it&#8217;s really nice to not be in the mainstream wagon because your favourite albums tend to be much cheaper (especially the old jazz stuff).

**I rarely buy CDs.** I only do it in specific cases. i.e. when I find a nice record shop (see below). I buy albums in digital format (MP3) most of the time.

**I prefer to listen to the whole album first.** I don&#8217;t like to buy specific tracks only. In my opinion, an album is a cohesive piece that is better enjoyed as whole. It tells a lot about the musical phase of the artists and their influences. Listening to a track alone is like hearing only one part of a longer story. There are exceptions of course.

**I&#8217;m ok to pay for music.** May sound silly to say that but this is not necessarily true for a lot of people these days :-P So, yes, if the price is not abusive and it&#8217;s music I&#8217;m interested in, I&#8217;m ok to pay for it.

**I focus on quality, not quantity.** This is actually one of the reasons I pay for the albums I really care about. It&#8217;s a way to slow down a bit and take my time to enjoy the stuff I have in more depth. I see people downloading a huge amount of albums from internet (e.g. the whole discography of artist A and B) just for the sake &#8220;having&#8221; them. They rarely listen to everything they download. After an album passes my initial gut test (i.e. sounds interesting, causes some reaction, etc), I listen to it several times to dissect it into the smallest details. I have a lot of fun doing it! For instance, this is what I did with [my favourite version of So What](http://www.lucasr.org/2010/04/12/my-favourite-so-what/) and other tunes.

**I discover new stuff through the web. <span style="font-weight: normal;">Duh, who doesn&#8217;t? I&#8217;ve used mp3 stores (7digital, Amazon, Ubuntu Music Store, and others), subscription-based stores (eMusic), and streaming services (Last.fm and Spotify Premium). To find new stuff to listen to, I usually follow a process of researching, sampling, and acquisition. Nowadays I use a combination of related artists listings from Last.fm, Wikipedia articles, and reviews from specialised websites (such as <a href="http://www.allaboutjazz.com/">AllAboutJazz</a>) for the research part; and Spotify for continuous sampling. If I decide that I really like the album or artist, I eventually buy the MP3 albums from Amazon. Nothing new here I guess.</span>**

**I love independent record shops. <span style="font-weight: normal;">I haven&#8217;t found my favourite/official one in London yet. Suggestions are welcome. Back in my Finnish days, I found a really nice record shop in Helsinki, where I would go every other week. Local music shops are really nice to meet other music fans, get good suggestions for your next album, etc.</span>**

**<span style="font-weight: normal;">Now, let me get back to this cool Myron Walden album I just found out about.</span>**
