14h32 pm: I'm here in [Assim](http://www.assimcomunicacao.com.br) and I'm a
sleepy man! That's the result of not speeling well for three days...

I had begun to work the GNOME User Guide brazilian portuguese translation but
[Shaunm](http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/) warned me that he hasn't finished it
yet. So, I'll wait for him 'cos I don't want to waste my time translating an
out of date doc

Here is a cool

of the samba-funk-rock band I play called
[PÃ£](http://www.tramavirtual.com.br/gvirtual/artista/index_2.jsp?id=5162) (in

I've been reading Leroi-Gourhan, Simondon, MÃ­lton Santos, Heidegger and other
for my mastering stuff.
