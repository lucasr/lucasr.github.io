It's time to start working on our 2007 annual report! Last year we had a very
nice report. So, let's make it even better this year! I've created a [wiki
page](http://live.gnome.org/FoundationBoard/AnnualReport2007) to organize the
work.

Any kind of contribution is welcome! There are several ways to help:

  * Assign yourself to write one of the sections
  * Add links, references and other information sources to help writers to
  produce the content
  * Add new ideas, suggest, review the content
  * Anything else! :-)

If you have any questions, feel free to contact the Annual Report Team
([Silvia](http://live.gnome.org/SilviaMiranda),
 [Sayamindu](http://live.gnome.org/SayaminduDasgupta) and me).
