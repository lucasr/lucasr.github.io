We've been discussing the idea of doing periodic topic-oriented hackathons in
the front-end team. The idea is simple: pick a topic—a specific part or aspect
of the product—and have the whole team focused on it for a couple days. The
goal is to bring substantial and fast improvements on specific areas.

As an initial experiment, we'll be doing the [first
hackathon](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Hacking/UIPolishingHackathon) this
week from Wednesday to Friday and we're going to focus on UI polishing
bugs—those UI papercuts that are not so prominent in isolation but, when fixed
en masse, make a whole lot of difference.

It's important to have a good list of bugs before we begin. So, you can start
nominating Fennec bugs for the hackathon now by tagging them with
"ui-hackathon". We'll cleanup this list and maybe prioritize them a bit during
the planning session on the first day of the hackathon.

As usual, everyone is welcome to participate. You can help us by tagging bugs,
or better yet, fixing them. Have a look at the [wiki
page](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Hacking/UIPolishingHackathon) for more
details on the agenda.
