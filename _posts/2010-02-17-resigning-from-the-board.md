I've been thinking a lot about what to do about my participation on GNOME
Foundation's Board of Directors in face of the fact that my wife and I are
expecting our first baby in February. After careful consideration, I decided to
resign. I want to be fully focused on my family (especially in the first few
months) without feeling bad for doing Board stuff while I could be with
my family or not doing Board stuff while I'm spending time with my family.

So, considering my priorities now, I feel that I would be more useful to the
Board by stepping down and letting another person with a lot of energy to take
my position on Board for the rest of this mandate. The Board has decided to
appoint <a href="http://castrojo.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Jorge
Castro</a> to replace me. He's highly motivated and I'm sure he'll give good
contributions as a member of the Board.

I've had a great time in my two and a half years on Foundation Board. It was a
great way to support the community in several ways and to work with some very
nice people. The GNOME Foundation is getting better everyday and I feel very
proud to be part of it.
