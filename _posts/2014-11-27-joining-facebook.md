I am really excited to announce that I'm joining Facebook in January! I'll be
bootstrapping Android UI efforts—frameworks and user-facing stuff—in the London
office. There are still a lot of details to sort out but that's the general
plan.

Why Facebook? They have an amazing hacker-driven culture, they're
[striving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzL6Zoy_ndk) to do open source the
right way, there's a lot of space for experimentation, and they have _massive_
reach in the Android space.

I’m really looking forward to learning a lot at Facebook. And there is so much
to be done! I can't wait to start :-)
