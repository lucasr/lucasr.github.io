My vacation is over since January 15th. I'm still catching up with GNOME and
work stuff and specially the timezone (jet lag of hell!). It was just wonderful
to be in Brazil for more than 20 days. I met my parents, my brother and quite
many relatives and friends. I basically stayed in three cities there: Rio de
Janeiro, Salvador and Arantina (a very small town in Minas Gerais state). I
took many pictures, have a look at this
