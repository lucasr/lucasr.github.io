As
[Behdad](http://mces.blogspot.com/2008/02/gnome-outreach-program-accessibility.html)
has already said, we've been working on this cool [GNOME Outreach Program:
Accessibility](http://www.gnome.org/projects/outreach/a11y/) for the past three
months. The program organized and promoted by the [GNOME
Foundation](http://foundation.gnome.org/) and sponsored by the GNOME
Foundation, Mozilla Foundation, Canonical, Google, and Novell. Read the
program's [press release](http://www.gnome.org/press/releases/gop-a11y.html).
The tasks will be published on March 1st.

This is a very nice opportunity to contribute to a highly relevant part of
GNOME. Participate!
