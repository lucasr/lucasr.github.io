Let's say **Welcome!** to our GSoC students! From now on, you'll see their blog
posts on Planet GNOME with this GSoC mini-banner:

Not many of them have sent me their blog feed info but I'm working on getting
most of our students on Planet as soon as possible. Students, it's time to
introduce yourselves! :-)
