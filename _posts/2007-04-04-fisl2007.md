So, I'll attend [FISL](http://fisl.softwarelivre.org) this year. I'll be giving
a talk about [Maemo](http://www.maemo.org) and another about the latest news of
[GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/). The latter is part of the [GNOME brazilian
community
meeting](http://fisl.softwarelivre.org/8.0/papers/pub/programacao/557) where
we'll also have a talk by the [pt_BR localization
team](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeBR/Traducao) and some discussion about
marketing activities, how to bring more brazilian contributors to GNOME and so
on. If you're planning to attend FISL next week and love GNOME, you can't miss
it! :-)

I'm really excited about FISL this year because it will be a nice oportunity to
go meet some of my best friends and nice free software people (well, those two
groups overlap in many cases).
