**Carol's blog**

Carol, my lovely wife, created a blog _(in portuguese)_ to post her impressions
about our daily life in Finland. Check out her [first
post](http://diariodeca.blogspot.com/2006/11/primeiros-dias-na-finlndia.html)!

**Finnish food impressions**

I've received lots of comments _(well, much more than I expected!)_ on my [last
post](http://blogs.gnome.org/view/lucasr/2006/11/08/0) about my first finnish
food impressions. Actually, I received support from many people at work. Funny
to see the finns defending their food in such a positive way! Actually, I've
received some cool restaurant suggestions. [tigert](http://www.tigert.com),
[Zetor](http://www.ravintolazetor.fi/eng/) is in my top list for future
dinners, let's go there!

_PS: If someone considered that post arrogant or felt offended in some way,
please don't. Those are just impressions from a foreigner, nothing more!
:-)_

**Nice coincidences**
