    The Good, The Bad and The Ugly by Justin Reed

I know. I'm late on the Western front. My father is a big fan of Western movies
but I never really got interested enough to watch any. Maybe because of the
[Long Tail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Tail) of movies in
[LoveFilm](http://www.lovefilm.com/), I ended up renting a couple [Spaghetti
Western](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_Western) classics: [Once Upon a
Time in the West](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_in_the_West)
and [The Good, The Bad and The
Ugly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good,_the_Bad_and_the_Ugly).

The cast in _Once Upon a Time in the West_ is quite nice: Charles Bronson,
Henry Fonda, Jason Robards, and Claudia Cardinale. The first scene of the
movie with the outlaws waiting for Harmonica at the train station is
genius! Same thing with _The Good, The Bad and The Ugly:_ great cast with
Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach; nice story line, interesting
characters, and so.

Both movies are directed by [Sergio
Leone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Leone). There are some common
aspects in both movies that are really spot-on — a result of Leone's direction
I guess. First thing is the close ups. It brings a strong focus on the
characters and their expressions. Second interesting aspect is the tempo. Both
movies are slow-paced and the scenes are relatively long. You quickly realize
where Tarantino found inspiration for some of his best movies such as _Kill
Bill_ and _Inglorious Basterds_.

The third aspect is the photography direction by [Tonino Delli
Colli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonino_Delli_Colli). The framing is
generally quite impressive. Beautiful stuff. Last but not least, the super
awesome score by [Ennio
Morricone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonino_Delli_Colli). The
[soundtrack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good,_the_Bad_and_the_Ugly_(song))
of _The Good, The Bad and The Ugly_ is so original and has been copied so many
times that it sounds like a cliché nowadays.

It's never late to start enjoying new things, isn't it? That was my case with
Western movies. I'll definitely watch more of them from now on. Next on my list
are the two other movies from Leone's [Dollar
Trilogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollars_Trilogy).
