I've just published the "0.1-alpha" version of my [new
website](http://lucasr.org). I definitely plan to do some incremental design
improvements but I'm quite happy with the initial state of things now. Working
with WordPress was a very good experience: a lot of Free themes and plugins,
easy to extend and customize, etc. It was funny to mess with PHP code
again, after 5 years far from any real web development. For some reason,
PHP felt quite annoying. Maybe it's just because I'm not used to it
anymore. Dunno.

The front page is inspired by Vimeo's front page textual updates (if you're a
Vimeo user, you know what I mean). They list all updates in one
paragraph that appear on top of the page content. Feels quite natural, less
techie, more human. Maybe a bit more verbose, but that's fine. Anyway, I
applied Â the same approach in my website's front page by having a short dynamic
paragraph that is generated from the data fetched from the web services I use
for blogging, microblogging, books, music and photos.

I won't be posting anything in blogs.gnome.org from now on. I've already
updated Planet to aggregate my new blog. Comments on the new website/blog are
welcome.
