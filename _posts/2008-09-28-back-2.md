Long time, no blog posts.

I've been going through a stressful UK visa process since mid-April and that
(in addition to several other small problems occured during this time)
gradually busted most of my energy for GNOME stuff. Anyway, the good news
is that the visa process is over and I'm back!

Some quick/random notes:

  * [GNOME 2.24](http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.24/) was
  released! Congratulations to everyone who contributed to this release!
  * The new much-saner session manager was integrated in GNOME 2.24! I was a
  bit worried about this because, in middle of the development cycle,  I
  realized that I wouldn't have time to finish what I
  [started](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2008-March/msg00193.html)
  on time for the 2.24 release. Fortunately, Jon McCan stepped up and made all
  the necessary major changes and fixes to make this release possible. So, big
  thanks to all contributors of this gnome-session release, especially, [Dan
  Winship](http://mysterion.org/~danw/blog/), [Jon
  McCan](http://blogs.gnome.org/mccann/), [Matthias
  Clasen](http://live.gnome.org/MatthiasClasen) and [Vincent
  Untz](http://www.vuntz.net/journal/)!
  * [litl](http://www.litl.com/) stuff is moving on very well: great team,
  exciting project. The whole LiTL team will meet in Boston during the week
  before [Boston Summit](http://live.gnome.org/Boston2008) and some of us will
  attend the Summit this year. If you're interested in working with us, talk to
  [Havoc](http://log.ometer.com/)!
  * [Carol](http://diariodeca.blogspot.com/) and I have been watching lots of
  movies. We got some DVD boxes: Die Hard, Band of Brothers, and The Godfather.
  Also, some TV series: Lost, In Treatment, Heroes, CSI, and others.
  * I created some "topic-oriented" pages in my blog to share my experiences
  with [jazz](http://blogs.gnome.org/lucasr/jazz/) and
  [wines](http://blogs.gnome.org/lucasr/wines/). I'll gradually increment the
  content of those pages. I'll write a new [musical
  snapshot](http://blogs.gnome.org/lucasr/category/life/snapshot/) soon as
  there are lots of new stuff to talk about now.
  * I bought a [Canon <span class="toctext">50mm f/1.8 II
  lens</span>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EF_50mm_lens)<span
  class="toctext">. Nice and relatively cheap. Here are <a
