    The Board 0.1.3
  </p>
</div>

Time for a new development snapshot release of [The
Board](https://live.gnome.org/TheBoardProject)! I've just uploaded the
[0.1.3](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2011-April/msg00078.html)
tarball. Get it while it's hot! So, what are user-visible changes?

The main feature of this release is the [webcam
support](http://lucasr.org/2011/04/04/cheese-in-the-board/) in photo elements
with Cheese[.](http://lucasr.org/2011/04/04/cheese-in-the-board/) It's fun,
it's magic! A couple of useful key shortcuts were added: Ctrl+N to add a new
page and Delete key to remove selected elements. An important [crasher
fix](http://git.gnome.org/browse/the-board/commit/?id=2e88494c62c47c70b0a02a9f9db78f7f267bc62e)—caused
by an update in gobject-introspection—is also included.

I should be updating [The Board's
PPA](https://launchpad.net/~the-board-team/+archive/dev-snapshots) with the new
release in the next days. Other distros should have updated packages soon. The
sad news is that the webcam support will not be available on Natty as it
doesn't ship Cheese 3.0. Everything else should work fine.

What's next? I will be working on the implementation of a storage layer based
on Tracker and a few important UI improvements. On other news, I'll be giving a
talk about The Board in the next [Desktop Summit](https://desktopsummit.org/).
Yay!
