As pointed out by [Carlos](http://www.notacloud.com/blog/) in GNOME Mobile
[mailing
list](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/mobile-devel-list/2007-May/msg00021.html)
and [Quim](http://desdeamericaconamor.org/blog/) in his
[presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/qgil/nokia-and-maemo-in-the-new-gnome-mobile-context/download)
at LinuxTag, Hildon will become an upstream project. The idea from now on is to
make Hildon a more independent and community-driven project as it's going to be
used in different contexts other than Maemo (i.e. [Ubuntu
Mobile](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2007-May/000289.html)).
This means that Hildon won't be a [Maemo](http://www.maemo.org)-specific
project anymore and will have its own release schedule, roadmap and community.

As a consequence, we decided to move the full Hildon stack to GNOME
infrastructure. This way we can stay closer to GNOME community and stimulate
collaboration between both projects. We've started the migration process
already but it will take some time because we need to first re-organize our
internal way of working to make sure everything is fine after the migration.
Big thanks to [Olav](http://blogs.gnome.org/ovitters) for the great and quick
help!

For those who don't know: what is Hildon?

> **Hildon** introduces a new desktop for handheld devices. It comprises a
> **lightweight desktop**, a set of **widgets optimized for handheld devices**,
> a set of **theming tools** and other complementary libraries and
> applications.

We've created a [page](http://live.gnome.org/Hildon) GNOME wiki. There you can
find a brainstorming space for the [release
schedule](http://live.gnome.org/Hildon/ReleasePlanning) and
[roadmap](http://live.gnome.org/Hildon/Roadmap), a status page for our
[migration](http://live.gnome.org/Hildon/MigrationToGnome) to GNOME, and how to
get involved in Hildon. We already have a [mailing
list](http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/hildon-list) in GNOME servers. If
you are interested in Hildon development, don't hesitate to subscribe!
