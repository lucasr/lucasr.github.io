I've been working on a lot of boring college tasks from some disciplines
(Operating Systems, Artificial Inteligence and Topics on Software Engineering).

I want to graduate as soon as possible!!! I can't take it anymore! All these
classes and works are making me crazy!

Last weekend I didn't do anything interesting... Next one I'll go with Carol
and her sister to the beach. I'm looking like a finish man (white as the
clouds). I definitely need to burn my skin and start to look like a latin
person. :-)
