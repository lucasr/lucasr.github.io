So, here I am in [Salvador](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador,_Bahia), the
city I was born in Brazil, after almost three years since my last visit. It's
an incredibly rich experience to be here after so long. I've been living abroad
since 2006 and it's interesting to notice how my perception of my own cultural
roots have changed so much since then.

During my undergrad years,Â I took an anthropology course where I learnt a bunch
of interesting things such as
[ethnography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnography), [cultural
relativism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_relativism), [cerebral
rubicon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_rubicon), etc. But one of the
most interesting concepts I learnt was the notion of
[strangeness](http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~hsstcfs/glossary.htm):

> The art or mental trick of making a social setting and behaviour within it
> appear as if the observer is encountered it as a stranger. If applied to
> mundane 'taken-for-granted' events, this can lead to unusual and
> original insights.

Living abroad gave me a wide range of opportunities to experience strangeness.
Salvador is a city where people are mostly
[Afro-Brazilians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Brazilian), relaxed, loud,
informal, easy-going, welcoming, talkative,
[syncretically](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism) religious ... you
got the idea. I guess you can imagine how culturally shocking it was to
move to Finland. Our move from Finland to England was much smoother of
course. I've become much more aware of my own origins because it's by
recognizing cultural differences that you get to know your own culture more
deeply.

On the flip side, the experience of living abroad for a relatively long time
inevitably involves some cultural adaptation: the more you stay abroad the more
you end up blending in. And now, visiting the city I was born in after so long,
I'm experiencing a sort of backwards strangeness. It's like I'm starting to
perceive my own culture from an outsider perspective. Many of those things
that I used to perceive as a given in terms of social behaviour, weather,
accent, slang, city organization, etc, are now things that I explicitly
notice. It's a bit like being a foreigner in your own country.

The bottom line is: after almost four years living abroad, I have never been
more aware of my origins and my cultural roots. On the other hand, I'm starting
to feel like a stranger in my own city. I'm in a sort of cultural limbo I
guess...
