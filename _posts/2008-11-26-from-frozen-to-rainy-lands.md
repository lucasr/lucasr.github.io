    Yet another London cliché!
  </p>
</div>

So, here I am, finally, in London. In the last 25 days (most of them without
internet access at home), Carol and I have been doing basic settling in
stuff, doing some sightseing, going to some nice concerts (I really love to
have a real cultural life again!), getting scared by the insanely high
living costs, and all other obvious things a couple would do in their first
month in London. So far, so good.

For us, there's a very strong relief feeling associated with this move. Mostly
because being in London marks the end of a very painful visa process (and all
the consequent problems) that we went through in last 5-6 months. I
feel a bit frustrated with all the wasted time and energy during this period.
It's like there's a kind of "hole" in my 2008 which made lose most of
motivation for a lot of things I love to do (which made me suck a lot as a
GNOME guy this year btw). On the other hand, the new life in London
brings me a refreshing energy now.

As you probably know, London is the land of clichés.Yes, anything you do has
probably been done by some milion of other people already. So, I couldn't help
myself to have cliché photo in this post!
