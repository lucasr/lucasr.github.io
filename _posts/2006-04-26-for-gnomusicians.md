Are you a happy GNOME contributor? Are you going to attend GUADEC? Do you know
how to play musical instruments? Piano? Guitar? Drums? Percussion? Bass? Sing?
Whatever?

If you answer is "Yeah!", you really should add your name to the [GNOME
Musician Index](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeMusicianIndex)! We're planning to
organize a GNOMErs Jam Session at GUADEC. I'm sure it will be VERY funny! You
just can't lose it!

As soon as I get some free time I'll blog about all the nice things that took
place at FISL and III Fórum GNOME.
