I'm a [COLOURlovers](http://colourlovers.com) fan. They provide a nice set of
simple creative tools that empower a vibrant community to produce awesome
design pieces such as [patterns](http://www.colourlovers.com/patterns),
[palettes](http://www.colourlovers.com/palettes),
[shapes](http://www.colourlovers.com/shapes),
[colors](http://www.colourlovers.com/colors), etc. It's a simple yet powerful
idea. Inspiring stuff.

I've been doing [Android-based
development](http://lucasr.org/2011/11/15/native-ui-for-firefox-on-android/)
for a few months now but I wanted to play a bit more with the platform to get a
better grasp on the end-to-end developer experienceâ€”from development to
distribution. There's no other way to do that than building an app. This is why
I created Pattrn as a weekend project.

[Pattrn](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lucasr.pattrn) gives
you access to all the patterns created by the COLOURlovers community. You can
browse through the latest and most popular patterns and search by keyword or
color. You can also keep a list of your favorite patterns and use them as your
Android wallpaper. Pattrn is meant to be simple, cute, and snappy.

I've just released Pattrn's first public beta on Google Play. [Install
it](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lucasr.pattrn) and let me
know what you think. I hope you enjoy it!
