If you are GNOME developer and want GNOME to rock on the [Google Summer of
Code](http://code.google.com/soc) this year, don't forget to add your ideas to
our [SoC project ideas pool](http://live.gnome.org/SummerOfCode2007/Ideas). We
have only 11 ideas in our pool page and I'm sure you, maintainers and
developers, have a lot of things in mind that you wanted to see implemented in
your and other's modules!
