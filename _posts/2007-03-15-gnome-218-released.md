Yes, Yes, exactly! [GNOME 2.18](http://www.gnome.org/start/stable) is released!
It's always nice to see such a nice result of hard work from so many people
(_have a look at the gnome-about dialog)_! Congratulations to everyone who
contributed in anyways to this [beautiful
release](http://www.gnome.org/start/2.18/notes/en)!

GNOME 2.18 is 100% translated to brazilian portuguese _(2.14 and 2.16 had
98%)_! A big thanks to the whole pt\_BR team: Leonardo Fontenelle
(pt\_BR hero!), Og Maciel (pt_BR hero!), Guilherme Pastore, Raphael Higino,
Washington Lins, Licio Fonseca, Alexandre de Menezes, Pedro de Medeiros,
Afonso Celso Medina, João Bueno Calligaris, André Noel, Raul Pereira,
Robson Negreiros, Everson Araujo, Vicente Aguiar, Vinicius Pinheiro, Amadeu
Júnior, Lucas Veloso, Claudio André, Franz Gustav Niederheitmann, Luiz
Fernando Armesto, Igor Soares, Jonh Wendell and Fábio Nogueira _(Sorry if I
forgot anyone_). I love you guys!

I'm really excited about what's coming for GNOME 2.20! Let's start our hard
(and super fun) work again! Go Go Go!
