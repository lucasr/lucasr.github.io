In the last few weeks, I've got three nice black devices:

  * [Nokia N81 8Gb](http://www.nokia.com/n81): I really like the design and
  mechanics of this device. The software has some additions but nothing really
  groundbreaking.
  * [PlayStation 3](http://www.playstation3.com/): I'm having lots of fun with
  both games that came with the console: Motor Storm and Resistance: Fall of
  Men.
  * [Macbook Black](http://www.apple.com/macbook/): Very nice design and
  hardware (with this "Santa Rosa" architecture). I've installed
  Gutsy. Unfortunately, I needed to rebuild the kernel 4-5 times in order to
  make keyboard, touchpad and sound to work. I don't have patience to build
  kernel anymore. I think I'm getting old... :-P

Now I'm prepared for the winter! Woohoo!
