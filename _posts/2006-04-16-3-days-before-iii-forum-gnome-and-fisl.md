I'm very excited [to](http://thomas.apestaart.org/)

[some](http://live.gnome.org/JohanDahlin)
[GNOME](http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/weblog/)
[fellows](http://live.gnome.org/GuilhermePastore)
[at](http://www.gettysfamily.org/wordpress/)
[FISL](http://fisl.softwarelivre.org) and [III Fórum
GNOME](http://forum.gnome.org). We'll have a very small booth there.
Unfortunately, we didn't get any sponsors to cover marketing material
(t-shirts, banners, flyers, live CDs, etc) costs. Well, I'm sure It won't make
us have less fun! I've arrived to Porto Alegre today. Let me know if you're
coming too!
