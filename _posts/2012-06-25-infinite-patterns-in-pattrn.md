Many users have been requesting the ability to see more patterns in
[Pattrn](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lucasr.pattrn). So
far, the list of latest, most popular, and search results have been limited to
50 patterns. Not anymore! In the latest update—now available on [Google Play
Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lucasr.pattrn)—all
pattern lists are infinite and will load more patterns on demand as you scroll
down.

This new update also features an important performance improvement on the
lists. Pattrn now pre-fetches patterns beyond the visible viewport to bring an
even smoother experience—hopefully you'll see less grey boxes. This is a work
in progress, more improvements are planned.
