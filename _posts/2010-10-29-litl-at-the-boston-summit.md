We at [litl](http://litl.com/) had to skip last year's
GNOME [Summit](http://live.gnome.org/BostonSummit) in Boston because we were
too busy releasing our first product, the
[webbook](http://www.litl.com/meet-webbook/overview.htm). But we wanted to
contribute with something this year. So, we'll doing something similar than [we
did in 2008](http://blog.ometer.com/2008/10/09/litl-at-summit-this-weekend/).

For the Boston Summit
[attendees](http://live.gnome.org/Boston2010/Participants), litl is buying
coffee, soft drinks, brownies, cookies, and a cheese plate on Sunday afternoon
from a [fancy French restaurant](http://www.ausoleilcatering.com/). We hope you
all enjoy it!

A few litl people will attend the Summit this year—Brad Taylor, Sandy
Armstrong, Johan Bilien, and maybe others. Brad and Sandy will participate on
the [Snowy hackfest](http://live.gnome.org/Hackfests/Snowy). Johan will be
giving a quick [technical
presentation](http://live.gnome.org/Boston2010/SessionProposals) about how
we're using GNOME platform maybe followed by a UI demo—surely a good
opportunity to know a bit more about what we've been [hacking
on](http://litl.com/workshop/whats-next.htm).
