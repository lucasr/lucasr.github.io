The GNOME Journal is preparing for another great new edition!

Join our We-tell-the-world-about-GNOME-and-it-rocks club, and find the love of
your life! The deadline for submitting articles is **December, the 1st.**.

The next edition is going to appear on **December, the 15th 2006**. General
information about the GNOME Journal, the submission guidelines, an other stuff
is available in the [wiki](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeJournal).

Don't forget to add you article to our [article submission
queue](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeJournal/ArticleSubmissionQueue)! Do this
within the next 24 hours and win flight tickets to
[Saturn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn). :-)

**Importante note:** GNOME Journal is urgently needing regular writers. Tip for
all GNOMErs (journalists, users, developers, lovers, all this at the same time,
etc): if you're planning to blog something more structured (be it an
opinion, a tutorial, an application review, desktop feature review,
development tips, etc) this is a good chance to submit an article
to GJ! GNOME Journal reaches a different (and very important)
audience from our mailing lists, GNOME Planet, wikis, etc. It's
about reaching the "outsiders" with high quality GNOME-related
content. Let's make the GJ's december edition rock!
