I've been listening to some good music. [Davi
Moraes](http://www2.uol.com.br/davimoraes/) is a guitarrist and composer from
Bahia who mixes [ijexá](http://www.bahia-online.net/afoxes-blocosafros.htm) and
black music. Another interesting brazilian artist with a similar style is
[Lucas Santanna](http://www.last.fm/music/Lucas+Santtana). In both Lucas'
albums ("Eletro Ben Dodo" and "Parada de Lucas") he plays with a very "light"
band with a strong base on acoustic guitar and african percussion (no drums).

Carol and I have been watching lots of movies. Some of them:

  * [Daredevil](http://imdb.com/title/tt0287978/) (nice)
  * [50 First Dates](http://imdb.com/title/tt0343660/) (cute but too obvious)
  * [Derailed](http://imdb.com/title/tt0398017/) (interesting!)
  * [Running Scared](http://imdb.com/title/tt0404390/) (so so)
  * [Superman Returns](http://imdb.com/title/tt0348150/) (rock!)
  * [Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest](http://imdb.com/title/tt0383574/) (very nice!)
  * [Freedomland](http://imdb.com/title/tt0349467/) (crap script)
  * [The Italian Job](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0317740/) (interesting)
  * [Munich](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0408306/) (cool)

The [III Festival Software Livre da Bahia](http://festival.softwarelivre.org/)
will take place on August 24, 25 and 26 at [UNIME](http://www.unime.com.br/) in
Lauro de Freitas/BA (a city very near to Salvador, the state capital). I'll be
giving 2 talks and 2 workshops:

  * _Talk_ — Intro to (aka Booting on) Free Software
  * _Talk_ — How to contribute to **GNOME**
  * _Workshop_ — Translating **GNOME** to Brazilian Portuguese
  * _Workshop_ — How to send your first patch to **GNOME**

The III Festival schedule has some very interesting talks from cool free
software people like Otavio Salvador (Debian), Gustavo Pacheco
(OpenOffice.org/BrOffice.org), Hugo Cisneiros (The Linux Manual/Fedora Brasil),
Imre Simon (USP), Pedro Kröger (Debian-BR-CDD/Lisp Brasil/Lilypond),
Alexandre Oliva (FSF Latin America), Sérgio Amadeu (USP), and many, many
others! What is really interesting about this event is that it gives a very
strong emphasis on the social role of free software. We try to connect the
free software movement with other social movements like the Solidary
Economy movement, public digital/social inclusion projects and so on. The
organization team has done a great job! Congratulations!

If you want to meet nice people, visit a wonderful place and attend a great
event for free, come to our Festival!
