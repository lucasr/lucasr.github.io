The magic of jazz comes mainly from the fact that it's fundamentally built
around improvisation. Reinventing the same tunes over and over again is a core
part of the culture among the jazz musicians. This is maybe why I find it so
cool to track all the ways by which certain tunes have been performed at
different gigs in various moments of jazz's history. I talked about my
favourite performance of the classic _So What_ in a [previous
post](http://lucasr.org/2010/04/12/my-favourite-so-what/). Now I'd like to talk
a bit about my favourite _Tutu_.

_Tutu_ was composed by the genius [Marcus
Miller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Miller) in 1986. It was originally
recorded as part of a Miles Davis' album with same name that was all composed,
arranged, and co-produced by Miller. What I find special about _Tutu_
(the tune) is that it shares a lot of the qualities of _So What_ by
working as a sort of minimalist platform for great improvisation. The
core foundation of Tutu comes from the 3-note bass line with a chord
progression that provides the perfect ground for intense solos. My
favourite performance of _Tutu_ is in an album called _Dreyfus Night
in Paris_ recorded in 1994, three years after Miles' death.

So, what makes this specific performance so cool? The personnel is fantastic:
Marcus Miller (bass), Michel Petrucciani (piano), Kenny Garrett (sax), Bireli
Lagrene (guitar), and Lenny White (drums). White and Garret have played with
Miles and other giants, Lagrene has a very interesting work with Pastorius, and
Petrucciani is just legendary. If you haven't heard of some of those guys, you
should definitely go look for them. You won't be disappointed!

The solos are fantastic! All of them start setting a quiet atmosphere, with
sparse notes and rhythm then go into more complex rhythmic and melodic
explorations until reaching a climax with high-pitched notes full of energy.
Garret's dissonant arpeggios are overwhelmingly cool. Lagrene brings in a
highly melodic solo full of tempo-bending riffs. Petrucciani has such a
Hancockian precision in his solo that it almost feels like he's composing a new
tune while improving. Finally, Miller turns his bass into a percussion
instrument while still playing the bass line.

So, in summary, _Tutu_ in _Dreyfus Night in Paris_ is 16 minutes of pure energy
with remarkable solos. Other people have
