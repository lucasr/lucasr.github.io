**II Fórum GNOME**

Since I came back from [II Fórum GNOME](http://forumgnome.com.br/2005/), I
didn't have any time for blogging. It's awful to arrive from a nice trip and
have to work hardly on a stressing project. First of all, It's always wonderful
to meet nice people like [Tim Ney](http://www.linuxgreenhouse.org/blog/tim/),
[Germán](http://blogs.gnome.org/gpoo),
[fatalerror](http://blogs.gnome.org/gpastore), Izabel (the main person behind
the Fórum organization, thanks Izabel!), Daniel Fink, Aparecido Quesada and
many others! It was the first time I personally met people involved with GNOME.
I gave a talk on GNOME Desktop present and future. The event schedule also had
talks on Linux Desktop, Mono, PHP-GTK2, GIMP and other related subjects. I and
fatalerror gave a workshop on GNOME translation with some good results: we
finished 2.12 translation and have one more active contributor in the team. The
event was als very nice in terms of local user and developer group
organization. Our plans are to be more prepared for GNOME marketing in Brazil
and to promote more local activities dedicated to people who want to start
contributing to GNOME. See some photos

**GNOME Foundation Board elections**

I'm very happy with the GNOME political dynamic related to the elections of the
board. Some very interesting discussion took place in
[foundation-list](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/) with
questions being answered by the candidates. IMHO, the board should be composed
by people with time, energy and well-defined and diverse visions (to estimulate
productive discussion). Therefore, here are my candidates: Jeff Waugh,
Luis Villa, Germán Poó Caamaño, Jonathan Blandford, Quin Gil, Dave Neary and
Vincent Untz.

**Music**

I played percussion with my brother's (Tiago Rocha) band in his show at ACBEU
Theater. His songs are mix of jazz, samba, bolero, classical and others.
Wonderful! Really!

Pretutu, the samba-funk-rock band I play with, started to record its first
album. I'll upload our songs somewhere as soon as the album gets ready!

Stuff I've been listening:

  * Vanessa da Mata
  * Fiona Apple
  * Rage Against the Machine

**Movies**

  * [Her Name is Carla](http://imdb.com/title/tt0326367/) (nice photography, bad script)
  * [Nicotina](http://imdb.com/title/tt0337930/) (very funny!)
  * [Oldboy](http://imdb.com/title/tt0364569/) (very nice!)
  * [Batman Begins](http://imdb.com/title/tt0372784/) (much better than the previous ones)
  * [Madagascar](http://imdb.com/title/tt0351283/) (not very funny)
  * Others that I don't remember now :-)
