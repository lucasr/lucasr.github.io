More quick comments:

  * Saw half of two talks by [Vincent](http://www.vuntz.net/journal/) about
  release notes and translation web tools and process. Cool stuff, as usual.
  * Spent most of the day on the advisory board meeting (which was a much
  better because of [Stormy](http://www.stormyscorner.com/)'s
  coordination).
  * Unfortunately, because of the advisory board meeting, I couldn't play
  soccer. Maybe next year?
  * Went for dinner with a bunch GNOME people.
  * After dinner, long conversation with Vincent about several GNOME topics
  (future of the project, board, new contributors, current situation, etc).
  * Tomorrow: one more release team meeting, one more board meeting, maybe will
  see some talks, and jam session at GUADEC's opening cocktail (you can't miss
  this!).
