We, Firefox Mobile front-enders, have been working hard for the last few weeks
to get the new [Firefox UI for
tablets](http://www.flickr.com/photos/61892693@N03/sets/72157627325688069/with/6052859709/)
in place for general testing. It has now reached a functional state that is
good enough for getting some early feedback. So, how can you help us?

First of all, you can simply install Fennec's [nightly
build](http://nightly.mozilla.org/) on your Android tablet and give us some
thoughtful feedback on the UI. File bugs for the missing bits from the planned
design, report interaction problems, let us know about broken bits, etc.

Secondly, if you want to contribute code, have a look at our current list of
[tablet-related bugs](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=655762)—see
the dependent bugs—and let us know what bugs you want to work on. Setting up a
Fennec development environment is fairly simple, you can find
[instructions](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Android) in the wiki. 
Feel free to ask for help either on IRC (#mobile at irc.mozilla.org) or on the
specific bug reports. Just ping mfinkle, mbrubeck, wesj, sriram, or me.

Keep in mind that this is very early stage work. There are lots of rough edges
and design is continuously evolving. In case you missed it, Ian Barlow, from
our Mobile design team, has
[blogged](http://ianbarlow.wordpress.com/2011/08/30/firefox-for-tablets/) about
the tablet UI design a couple of weeks ago—definitely worth reading. This is
all looking very promising and we can't wait to get it out to users once it's
ready!
