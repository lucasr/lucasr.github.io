So, we have finally announced the [GNOME 3.0
plan](http://live.gnome.org/ThreePointZero/Plan). I'm really confident about
this plan. I'm sure a lot of new cool stuff will happen to GNOME from now on.
Let's make it happen!

and [Andre](http://blogs.gnome.org/aklapper/2009/04/02/gnome3schedule/) blogged
about it too.
