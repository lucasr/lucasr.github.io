EOG 2.13.1 is released! This is the first EOG development release and my first
release as a co-maintainer. [Tim](http://blogs.conary.com/index.php/tgerla) has
been very busy at work and other stuff. So we'll work together on EOG
maintainership. See
[NEWS](http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/eog/NEWS?rev=1.82&view=markup) to know
what's new. Basically, this a heavy-bug-cleaning release. EOG had lots of
crashes that needed to be solved. Cleaning these crashes is the first step of
our [roadmap](http://live.gnome.org/EyeOfGnome) for GNOME 2.14.
