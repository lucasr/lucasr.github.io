I'm flying to Brazil tomorrow on vacation. I won't be very responsive for
anything until I come back to Helsinki on January 14th. So, this is a good time
to wish everyone a very nice Christmas and a wonderful New Year! 2007 was
definitely an amazing year for me. I hope 2008 to be even better! Woohoo!
