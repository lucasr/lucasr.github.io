This year's [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org/2012/) was a special one for me. It was
the first time I attended it as a Mozillian! I had already met quite a few
European community members at [MozCamp
Europe](https://wiki.mozilla.org/EU_MozCamp_2011) last year but this FOSDEM was
a great opportunity to meet even more Mozillians face-to-face. I stayed at the
[Mozilla DevRoom](http://fosdem.org/2012/schedule/track/mozilla_devroom) most
of the conference but also spent some time catching up with my fellow
[GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/) hackers.

Chris and I gave a ["State of Firefox
Mobile"](http://fosdem.org/2012/schedule/event/the_state_of_firefox_mobile)
talk on Sunday. I usually don't share my slides because they tend to be too
short in content to be useful. However, we wrote some speaker notes that give
enough information and context on what we talked about. So, here's the
[deck](http://speakerdeck.com/u/lucasr/p/the-state-of-firefox-mobile)
alternating between slides and speaker notes—I wish [Speaker
Deck](http://speakerdeck.com/) had proper support for speaker notes...

All in all, I had a great time at FOSDEM this year! PS: The weather during the
conference was quite special too—in a painful way!
