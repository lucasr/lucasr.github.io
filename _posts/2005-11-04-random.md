  * I love [CIA Open Source Notification System](http://cia.navi.cx). It's the
  free software [Big
  Brother](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_%281984%29)! You can watch
  commits from several projects in real time by joining FreeNode #commits
  channel.
  * Music: [Maria
  Rita](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&searchlink=MARIA|RITA|?&uid=CAW030511042254&sql=11:tu548qpnbtz4~T0)'s
  latest album "Segundo" is cool! [Vanessa da
  Mata](http://www.vanessadamata.com.br)'s "Essa Boneca Tem um Manual" is even
  better!
  * Movies: [The Final Cut](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0364343/) (regular),
  [Assault on Precinct 13](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0364343/) (regular),
  [True Crime](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0139668/) (nice!) and [The Constant
  Gardener](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0387131/) (EXCELENT!)
  * Work: it's been very boring to work on web development stuff at work. I
  wish I have an oportunity to work with something different than that.
