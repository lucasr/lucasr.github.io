### Music

[Luis](http://tieguy.org) suggested me to listen to Miles Davis' "Sketches of
Spain" album. Well, I liked it, very good one.  Specially the "Concierto De
Aranjuez" songs. Though, the album is too much "classical" in some ways. I
liked "Bitches Brew" more. :-)

Last week, I played with Pã twice. Good shows. In the other band, Paroano Sai
Milhó, we'll start recording our 4th album. The recording process per se is
very repetitive and tiring but the end result is always compensative!

### Readings

I've been reading some interesting books about democracy and ciberspace:

  * [Democracy in the Digital Age](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0415924367/102-0554755-2707361?v=glance) by Anthony G. Wilhelm
  * [Cyberpolitcs](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0847687430/102-0554755-2707361?v=glance) by Kevin A. Hill

### Work

It's been hard to me to have to work on things (mainly web development) that I
don't feel almost any pleasure. I wish I could work on GNOME more
(quantitatively and qualitatively), this would be REALLY great. Well, just
dreaming...

### Gift and Free Software

I'm reading some basic work about the "gift" sociological Marcel Mauss
(anti)-paradigm. I strongly suggest reading this Godbout [introdutory
article](http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0102-69091998000300002&lng=pt&nrm=iso)
(in portuguese). Those who are involved in free software communities will have
lots of insights about why we hackers do what we do.
[Mauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Mauss) paradigm seems to be the
sociological aproach that best explain lots of aspects of free software
culture.

### Tiny hack

I and [my great friend Aurélio](http://aurium.cjb.net) hacked firestarter to
fix a [little problem](http://bugs.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=314951).
