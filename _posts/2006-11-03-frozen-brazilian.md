Here I am in Finland. Long time no blogging. The last three weeks were very
intensive and demanding (in all aspects) for me and Carol: apartment search,
initial work-related activities, first zero-degree weather, first
snow, first days in a totally strange place. It's been a tragicomic
experience (much more comic than tragic!). Finland is the exact
oposite of Brazil in terms of culture (cold, quiet, silent,
**extremely** organized, "self-service society"), economy
(developed country, excelent social benefits for everyone, very
expensive life, no poverty), politics (the least corrupt country of
the world), weather (**very** cold, windy, and snowy). We're are
living in Espoo, very close to Helsinki, 15 minutes from office. Our
neighborhood, Matinkyla, is beautiful and near to everything we need
in a daily basis: supermarkets, drugstores, clothes stores, fast
food, restaurants, etc.

Work is great! Office is cool, people are kind. The coolest thing is that I'll
be working on the Desktop UI Framework Team which, as
[Karoliina](http://www.karoliinasalminen.com/blog/?p=148) has already
mentioned, will try to get even closer to the GNOME community as our work has
lots of similarities (I'll write more about it in the next days). It's just
wondeful to be able to work on cool things as your official job!

I've been posting lots of pictures in
[Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/lucasrocha/) from my
[N93](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N93). Also I've been posting some videos to
YouTube with some daily frivolous activies in Finland but they are private,
just for family and friends. If you want to watch them and you're a not
a stranger, send me your YouTube login and I'll give you permission to
watch them.

I hope to get back to my GNOME activities as now I have computer and internet
connection at home. EOG has 186 open bugs! Normally I keep this list with less
than 90. Lot of work to do! Cooool!

That's all for now! A brazilian GNOME developer is back. And now with much more
ice!
