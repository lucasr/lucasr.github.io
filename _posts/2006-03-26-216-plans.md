I've just posted the [EOG](http://live.gnome.org/EyeOfGnome/RoadMap) and
[Zenity](http://live.gnome.org/Zenity) 2.16 plans. Have look, assign to some
task, give some love to GNOME! :-)

I'm happy to see that my [post about new contributors
barriers](http://blogs.gnome.org/view/lucasr/2005/12/18/0) had some influence
on the [Gnome Goals](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeGoals). Nice!

The article submission deadline for the 8th issue of [Gnome
Journal](http://www.gnomejournal.org/) is April 1st. Don't lose it! GJ is
always waiting for new writers with good articles!

23 days before the [III Fórum GNOME](http://forum.gnome.org/) and [7th Fórum
Internacional Software Livre](http://fisl.softwarelivre.org). Don't forget to
[tell us](http://live.gnome.org/PortoAlegre2006) you're coming!
