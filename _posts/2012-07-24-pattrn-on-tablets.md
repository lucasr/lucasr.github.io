Yes, that's right! I've just pushed an update featuring a brand new
tablet-optimized UI for
[Pattrn](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lucasr.pattrn). The
tablet UI is designed to give you quick access to all your stuff—favourites,
wallpaper history, and saved searches—from a simple and beautiful home
screen—works beautifully on the Nexus 7 by the way. This update also
features landscape mode on the phone UI.

This is by far the most exciting Pattrn release to date. Big thanks to [Arnaud
Vallat](https://plus.google.com/u/0/105296433780150805762/posts), [Jake
Wharton](https://plus.google.com/u/0/108284392618554783657/posts), [Michael
Novak](https://plus.google.com/u/0/104502854123654699345/posts), and [Roman
Nurik](https://plus.google.com/u/0/113735310430199015092/posts) for giving
early feedback on this release.
