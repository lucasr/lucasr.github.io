UI implementation has an almost natural tendency to diverge from its intended
design. Those beautiful pixel-perfect design comps go through the brutal
reality of software development in the form of deadlines, roadmap changes,
miscommunication, platform limitations, and bugs, lots of bugs. The
final product is very often _not quite_ what you originally
envisioned.

This is what I call the Gap.

Pixel imperfection, inconsistent behaviour, unexpected user flow,
responsiveness issues, visual glitches, janky animations. You name it.
The Gap is on all these unintended UI bits that end up in the release.

Unfortunately, the Gap is not something you can avoid entirely. Software
development is no simple business, there is always _something_ you let
slip or have to compromise when you’re building anything non-trivial.

There are a number of factors in the development process that affect the
Gap—for better and worse. Design process is definitely one of them.

Generally speaking, the larger the distance between the design and engineering
teams, the worse the Gap tends to be. The way design is approached in the
development process has a great influence on how well designers and UI
engineers interact.

For example, many companies adopt a _waterfall_ design process—especially large
corporations where there is a sharper split of roles between teams. Designers
spend a long time working on their specs, detailing every single aspect of the
product or feature and UI engineers only start working on it once the specs are
"done".

The danger with the _waterfall_ design process is that it might create a
disconnection between design and engineering teams due to the focus on
deliverables and specs instead of the much-needed fluid communication between
the teams.

Why is it so important to have designers and engineers working very closely?
First, there are a number of issues that you only spot once you actually try
the design ideas. If designers don’t engage with engineers, the product will
likely stick with broken and/or unintended design.

Furthermore, design issues are tricky in that they have this qualitative side
that tends to be invisible to untrained eyes. Design problems will not
necessarily be caught by even the most competent QA team or the most solid UI
tests—because both are usually focused on the functional correctness of the
product. Designers are naturally the ones who tend to be more sensitive to
these design-level issues. This is why their engagement with the engineering
team is so vital.

With that said, the design team rarely has the bandwidth to do design QA work,
especially on large and complex projects. This is why having design-minded
engineers can make a massive difference because they can set much higher
bar for the UI quality right from the initial implementation and
beyond—instead of relying solely on the designers to do so.

The bottom line is that the design process does not end with the specs, no
matter how complete they look. In fact, design specs are just the beginning.

Iterative design processes that engage designers and engineers very early tend
to result in higher UI quality because it provides the necessary flexibility
and agility to steer ideas as they are implemented. Sounds obvious but this is
much easier said than done. Just see how rare is to find products with
outstanding user interfaces.

A substantial part of the UI engineer’s work is about fighting the Gap by
implementing user interfaces that are as close as possible to their intended
design. After all, the best user interfaces are the ones that feel
_intentional_ even on the smallest details.

So, mind the Gap.
