EOG development is going a litle bit slower than I wanted but it's going very
well actually. [As I said
before](http://blogs.gnome.org/view/lucasr/2006/11/16/0), The heavy development
is taking place in [eog-ng](http://svn.gnome.org/svn/eog/branches/eog-ng/)
branch which we plan to merge in the beginning of 2.20 development cycle (aka
2.19.x). See [eog-ng wiki page](http://live.gnome.org/EyeOfGnome/EogNg)
for more information. I'll try to list the nicest recent news.

**Tangofied themable EOG icon**

Thanks to [Ulisse](http://ulisse.wordpress.com/) we now have a new official
tango compliant icon.

As a wonderful surprise, Carol, my wife, managed to get a brand new t-shirt
with the new EOG logo as christmas gift. Isn't she lovely? :-)

**Printing**

Thanks to [Claudio](http://www.gnome.org/~csaavedr/news.html) EOG now have a
simple, user friendly and powerful way for printing image. You can define
exacly how you want to print the image in the paper and you do this in WYSIWYG
way. Side note is that it's been commited trunk and eog-ng branch. So it will
be available already in GNOME 2.18.

**EOG website**

Thanks to [Trond Danielsen](http://trondd.blogspot.com) we now have an EOG
website online. The website uses the project template for consistency. Click
[here](http://www.gnome.org/projects/eog) to check it out!

**New collection pane**

I'm experiment some new things in the collection pane. Basically, I'm trying to
use a one-row-with-horizontal-scrolling aproach. Thumbnails now have a context
menu with common used actions. Also, Inspired by the Fickr Organizr I added
some buttons to smothly scroll through the image collection. Of course it still
needs some polishing and I'd like to get some feedback about it. Comments?

**Image properties**

I chose to replace the image information side pane with a image properties
dialog. It's less invasive than the side pane and has navigation capabilities
which means you can easily check images info and metadata without having to
close-and-open dialog for each image. This is a work in progress.
Ideas/comments/suggestions should be posted in [bug
313676](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=313676).

**EXIF automatic orientation**

As some of you probably noticed, since 2.17.3 (patch still to be ported to
eog-ng branch) EOG has support for automatic orientation of images
based on EXIF info. One
[issue](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=390266) stil needs to solved
but the general funcionality is already working.

**New code base**

The code base in eog-ng branch brings a lot of stability to EOG and the code is
much more maintanable. Also, in theory (I still need to do some profiling to
confirm) the eog-ng code should use less memory and should be faster
than trunk. Some useful command-line options were added to start EOG in
fullscreen mode (-f), slideshow mode (-s) and with collection pane disabled
(-c).
