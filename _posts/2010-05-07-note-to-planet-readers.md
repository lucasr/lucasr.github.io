I decided to use a tag-specific feed in the two
[Planets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software)) aggregating my
[blog](http://lucasr.org/blog) posts:  [Planet GNOME](http://planet.gnome.org/)
and [Planeta GNOME Brasil](http://planeta.br.gnome.org/). I'm planning to post
more often about some "off-topic" topics
([music](http://www.lucasr.org/category/music/),
[food](http://www.lucasr.org/category/food/), personal stuff,
[drawings](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasrocha/sets/72157623236081517/),
etc) and I don't want to cause too much distraction to Planet readers.

That doesn't mean I'll only aggregate GNOME-related posts in those Planets from
now on. It's just that I want to explicitly select what goes in and what
doesn't.

So, if you're a Planet reader and for some crazy reason you feel like you don't
want to miss any of my blog posts, subscribe directly to my
[feed](http://www.lucasr.org/feed/) or follow me on
[Identi.ca](http://identi.ca/lucasr) or
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/lucasratmundo).
