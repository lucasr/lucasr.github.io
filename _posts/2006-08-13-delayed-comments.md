Long time no blog. Since GUADEC I haven't been posting anything here.

More than 2 months after GUADEC, I have to say that this was one of the most
incredible experiences of my life. It was definetely a turning point for me
inside GNOME. My feeling of **belonging** is much stronger now.

I had the lucky to have funny, interesting and rich chats with Sri Ramkrishna,
David Trowbridge, Davyd Madeley, Vincent Untz, Elijah Newren, Fernando
Herrera, Carlos Garnacho, Claudio Saavedra, Gustavo Barbieri, John Hwang,
Luis Menina, Paulo Henrique Silva, just to mention some. The Fluendo party
was awesome and Nokia's was incredible with the Drooling Macaque band.
It was amazing to have fun and play some good music with Davyd Madeley,
Carlos Garnacho, Thomas Wood, John Palmieri, Edward Hervey, and Robert
McQueen! Thanks you guys!

With no fear of being repetitive I say: Luis, you're right: **GNOME is
all about people!**
