[Google Summer of Code 2007](http://code.google.com/soc/2007) is officially
over. I think it's a good moment to give a summary of the participation of
[GNOME in SoC](http://live.gnome.org/SummerOfCode2007/) this year.

  * A [pool of SoC project ideas](http://live.gnome.org/SummerOfCode2007/Ideas)
  was brainstormed and triaged in l.g.o. The triaging and prioritization of the
  pool improved a lot the quality of the information we provided to the
  interested students.
  * We received 174 proposals. Lots of duplicates but quite many good quality
  proposals.
  * [29 proposals](http://live.gnome.org/SummerOfCode2007/AcceptedProposals)
  were accepted. Of those, 2 were dropped in the middle-term evaluation. The
  final evaluation hasn't been done yet but I'm quite confident that almost all
  projects have succeeded in different ways and levels. Some projecs were about
  development of new applications and others about new features on existing
  software modules. Some projects results will be available very soon in GNOME
  2.20!
  * The students were requested to send weekly progress reports to
  [gnome-soc-list](http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gnome-soc-list). If
  you want to check how the projects evolved, have a look at the mailing list
  [archives](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-soc-list/).
  * Some of the SoC students had their blog feeds added to [Planet
  GNOME](http://planet.gnome.org/). Their blog posts had a [special SoC
  mark](http://planet.gnome.org/heads/logos/gsoc2007.png).
  * Around 14 SoC students attended [GUADEC](http://www.guadec.org) this year.

My big and special thanks go to...

  * the **GNOME SoC admins** ([Vincent](http://www.vuntz.net/blog/),
  [Behdad](http://mces.blogspot.com/) and
  [Christian](http://www.advogato.org/person/gicmo/)) who contributed
  as much as they could to make SoC happen in GNOME.
  * the **project mentors** who did an excelent and important job on helping
  the students to achieve their goals and to get involved with the GNOME
  community.
  * the **SoC students** who gave important contributions to GNOME in terms of
  code, time and passion. I really hope to have all of them as active GNOME
  contributors from now on.
  * the **Google SoC organizers** who made all this possible.

Being a SoC admin this year was a very nice experience for me. So, thanks to
everyone involved! Let's make GNOME SoC rock even more in 2008! Woohoo!
