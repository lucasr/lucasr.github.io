One of the ["ongoing"
activities](http://live.gnome.org/MarketingTeam#head-79f0ca0acda884f1befbe63ba5063339f0ba56af)
of the [Marketing Team](http://live.gnome.org/MarketingTeam) is _Collect and
document GNOME deployments_. It seems the [list of
deployments](http://live.gnome.org/MarketingTeam/GnomeDeployments) we have
today doesn't correspond to reality. For example, I'm sure Brazil has much more
than 4 cases. There lots of people using and loving GNOME right now and we just
don't know anything about them.

Based on a [Jeff](http://perkypants.org)
[post](http://perkypants.org/blog/2006/03/04/the-red-phone/) about the _The Red
Phone_, I had the idea of a big "institutional" campaign to gather more and
better information about the successful GNOME deployment cases around the
world.

This campaign (in practice) would involve:

  * A w.g.o front page banner
  * An official announcement (that local groups would spread around free
  software related websites and mailing lists in several languages)
  * A translatable web page with general information about the campaign with a
  form or list of contacts for deployment report submission. I thought about
  the following required information for each submission:
      * Title
      * Deployer type (company, education, digital inclusion, NGO, etc.)
      * Summary
      * Full description (organizations involved, background, human interest,
      personalities and hopes — as [suggested by
      murrayc](http://live.gnome.org/MarketingTeam/GnomeDeployments)
      — _We want believable, compelling stories._)
      * Number of users/Number of computers
      * Technical information (distribution used, specific GNOME Desktop configuration details)
      * Photos (links)
      * Testimonials (from users, local authorities, IT people, etc.)

These deployment cases could be on Front Page as
[planned](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWeb) for the new w.g.o (_Happy users
enjoying GNOME in various cool ways_). Also, they can provide initial contacts
for future [GNOME Journal](http://www.gnomejournal.org/) articles.

Knowing who is using the software we develop is a very important step for the
[10x10](http://live.gnome.org/10x10) goal because succesful deployments
bring more respectability and trust on GNOME.
