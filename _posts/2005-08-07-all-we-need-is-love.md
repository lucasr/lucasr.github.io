New "All we need is love!" Zenity release (2.11.91). Again, almost nothing
newâ€”we're feature (and, from now on, string) frozen.

New and updated translations (thank you dudes!):
  * Artur Flinta [pl]
  * Laursen Dhima [sq]
  * Hendrik Brandt [de]
  * Funda Wang [zh_CN]
  * Ilkka Tuohela [fi]
  * Chao-Hsiung Liao [zh_TW]

You can get it
