Great news! **The Drooling Macaque Band** will make a concert at **GUADEC2007
in Birmingham**. This is because the conference agenda fits perfectly on ours
because it starts in 15th July, just after our concert with Jamiroquai, and
goes until 21st of July, just before our concert with U2 and Radiohead. This
means that we're available for the whole conference time and we will make
GUADEC 2007 rock even more because...

1. We rock!
2. We play "Wish You Were Here" and "Come Together"
3. We rock!
4. We organize jam sessions which makes everyone have fun
5. We rock!
6. Ah... we rock!

_(Hmm, we could make a song out of this...)_

Of course we're a very organized band and have setup a [wiki
page](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeMusicianIndex/Guadec2007Concert) for
GUADEC2007 stuff. If you don't believe we rock, have a look at some
[pictures](http://www.flickr.com/search/groups/?q=band&w=96765951%40N00&m=pool)
and a [video](http://www.netdrain.com/drooling-macaques.avi) of our previous
GUADEC concert at Vilanova (Spain).

It seems the concert will take place on Tuesday night during a cool conference
party. If you're interested in being part of the world famous **GNOME** band,
add your name in the [wiki
page](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeMusicianIndex/Guadec2007Concert) and be
aware that we'll probably do a rehearsal some day before the concert. Of
course, the idea is to give space for a **jam** after the concert, so if
you play some instrument, feel free to add your name there too.

 **Seriously**, this is going to be **fun**.
