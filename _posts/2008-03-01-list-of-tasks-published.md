For those interested in participating in the [GNOME Outreach Program:
Accessibility](http://www.gnome.org/projects/outreach/a11y), you probably want
to have a look at the [list of
tasks](http://www.gnome.org/projects/outreach/a11y/tasks/) that has just been
published in the program's website.

So, now what? Read the [program
rules](http://www.gnome.org/projects/outreach/a11y/rules/) very carefully and
claim one of the available
[tasks](http://www.gnome.org/projects/outreach/a11y/tasks). Proposals
acceptance is open now! Go Go Go!
