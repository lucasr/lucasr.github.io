    Our mugs
  </p>
</div>

Certain personal objects follow us through different moments of our lives. You
never think about them. But they're just always there. You might move to
a different city, or even another country, but you always keep them for some
reason. Our mugs are like this.

My mug, the yellow one with a fish, was a present from my mother when she came
to [Espoo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espoo) to visit us for the first time
in Finland. She came to spend our first Xmas abroad with us. This was in 2006.
It's a mug from [Recife](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recife),
[Pernambuco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pernambuco). It quickly became my
favourite because it was larger and cuter than the ones we used to have â€”
some dull green mugs from Ikea.

My wife's mug, the white one with red flowers, was a gift I gave her on
the Brazilian Valentine's Day (June 12). I bought it at
[Iittala](http://www.iittala.com/web/Iittalaweb.nsf/en/home), a nice Finnish
design shop. For instance, they sell those classic [Alvar
Aalto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvar_Aalto)&#8216;s amoeba-shaped
[vases](http://www.aalto.com/aalto-vases.html). The mug has been her favourite
mug since then because it's simple and stylish.

Those mugs has been with us for 3-4 years. We brought them from Finland to
England. They carry some happy memories in them. So, why not keeping them,
right?
