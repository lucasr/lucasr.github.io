As you probably know, according to our development
[schedule](http://live.gnome.org/TwoPointNineteen), we are officialy
feature-frozen now. Therefore, it's time to cleanup and update our
[Roadmap](http://live.gnome.org/RoadMap) to reflect the actual result of our
development work in the 2.19/2.20 feature set.

We kindly ask you check the roadmap[2] of the modules you maintain. If there
are features that were not implemented for 2.20, please move those to GNOME
2.22 section accordingly. In case there are some features missing there, please
add those to the respective section.

You can either directly edit the wiki page or reply us with the new roadmap
information.

It's very important to cleanup and update the GNOME Roadmap as soon as possible
so that it can be used as a reliable source of information for writing the
GNOME 2.20 release notes.

**Update:** If you want to update your [module-specific roadmap wiki
page](http://live.gnome.org/RoadMap/Modules) as well, feel free to do so. This
will save you some time later for sure.
