It's been quite some time that you Felix Riemann and Claudio Saavedra have been
doing all the development work in EOG and I think it's time to pass the ball to
them. So, this is just to let everyone know that I'm officially passing the EOG
maintainer post to them.Thanks Felix and Claudio for the great work!
