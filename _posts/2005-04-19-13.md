On saturday I gave a talk about [Hacker Culture](
http://coisa.im.ufba.br/~lucasr/pessoal/palestras/fisl-hackers.sxi) at
the [HÃ©lio Rocha College](http://www.heliorocha.com.br). My desknode didn't
work and I had to give up from my OO.o slides right on time of the session.
Desknotes are terrible. I need to buy a tiny laptop to carry with me anywhere I
go.

I found an amazing gnome app to manage book collections. It's called
[Alexandria](http://alexandria.rubyforge.org). With Alexandria, you can
retrieve book main information by just providing its ISBN number. For this
task, It uses some book info providers like Amazon and B&N. It was not
translated to brazilian portuguese but now it is! :-) Now I'm the maintainer of
the brazilian translation of Alexandria.

I've just begun to work on a simple patch to make Gnome System Tools [give more
than one auth trials](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169837). I
think I'll have some more time to work on it from now on.
