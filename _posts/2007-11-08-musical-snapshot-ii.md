So, after almost 2 months since my first [Musical
Snapshot](http://blogs.gnome.org/lucasr/2007/09/13/musical-snapshot/), I think
it's a good time to bring an update of what I've been listening to. In general,
I've focused more on jazz artists.

I've been thinking a lot about some general aspects of music production
nowadays. I have this feeling that the recent (good) albums have been failing
(in different levels) on bringing a more emotional and deep musical experience.
Today, most albums have this annoying super-high level of perfection. There's
almost no space for those wonderful little mistakes, improvisation, background
noises, emotion, ... When you listen to a jazz album from the 50's, 60's or
70's, you have this feeling of a deep musical engagement from the musicians.
The recordings were kind of noisy but very powerful. When I listen to some
modern jazz albums, even with very good musicians, I have the impression that
the technique comes first, nothing really groundbraking.

Another aspect that I've been thinking a lot is the use of electronic elements
in music. Electronic music is cheap, it's easy. In my opinion, there's this
natural tendency of electronic music to be shitty. The cultural relevancy of
electronic music is undeniable. But not everything is music. This is why I tend
to prefer artists who play with a band with real instruments instead of just a
DJ. For entertainment, electronic music works fine most of the time but for
listening, rarely. At least this is my experience.

**Update:** By all wrote above I do **not** mean that: 1) any jazz music is
wonderful (independently of the period); 2) any electronic music is crap; 3)
I'm a purist and only enjoy music with accoustic instruments; 4) I only enjoy
the "old stuff". My point about electronic music is that with very little
effort and knowledge, you can come up with “something”. Culturally speaking,
this is amazing (power to everyone to express themselves). However,
musically speaking, this can be really bad in many cases. On music, what
I really care is the "mood", the "feeling" and the "truth" in it.

**Jazz**

_I have this long road ahead with the fundamentals of jazz. So, I've been
choosing the "classics" to "understand" some of the major artists. Coltrane is
still on the top of my favorites. I've listened to more than 7 of his albums.
Wes Montgomery was a wonderful finding for me (I've listened to 6 of his albums
so far). Miles Davis' "Bitches Brew" album is freakingly amazing. Here
are some highlights (from the quite long list of albums I've listened to):_

  * Blue Train (John Coltrane)
  * Bitches Brew (Miles Davis)
  * Full House (Wes Montgomery)
  * The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery (Wes Montgomery)
  * Alive (Chick Corea Akoustic Band)
  * Complete Live at the Five Spot (Thelonious Monk Quartet with John Coltrane)
  * Plays Duke Ellington (Thelonious Monk)

**Funk and Acid Jazz**

_Following the acid jazz path, I've listened to 2 albums of The Brand New
Heavies. Interesting stuff. On the funky front, I've tried some more albums of
Earth Wind & Fire, Funkadelic, Parliament, Maceo Parker, and others. The Meters
is really root-ish funk music. If you like funk, you gotta listen to some of
their albums._

  * All about funk (The Brand New Heavies)
  * Spirit (Earth Window & Fire)
  * Funk Overload (Maceo Parker)

**R&B and Soul**

_Not many news here. I've listened to 3 albums of Amel Larrieux. Good music,
sometimes too "cheap"._

  * Infinite Possibilities (Amel Larrieux)

**Brazilian music**

_I've been re-trying some old albums of Djavan. There are some recent albums
that I don't really enjoy but the older stuff is amazing. Specially "Luz",
"Coisa de Acender" and "Novena". The new Maria Rita album "Samba Meu" is
quite good (as usual). If you want to get a taste of modern samba, you
should try it._

  * Samba meu (Maria Rita)
  * Luz (Djavan)
  * Clara Nunes (Clara Nunes)

**Ongoing stuff**

_I've started a research on mexican and african music. My initial names on the
mexican field are Lila Downs, Chavela Vargas, Lola Beltrán, José Alfredo
Jiménez and other "ranchera" artists. On the african side, the initial ones are
Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Thomas Mapfumo, Fela Anikulapo Kuti, Richard Bona,
Mulatu Astatke and others. I'm still "digesting" them. Soon, I'll
write a new Musical Snapshot with some comments and impressions about
them. If you have suggestions, please let me know._
