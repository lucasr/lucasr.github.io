This is the first stable release of **Eye of GNOME** (EOG) as part of the
**GNOME 2.20** major release. The 2.20 release is very special for EOG as it's
the first one with a **complete rewrite/refactoring** of its core. This means
that GNOME now has a much **improved** image viewer. There lots of cool **new
features**, we really hope you all enjoy! Many thanks to everyone who
contributed to this release, specially to EOG's team members, **Claudio and
Felix**.

So, what's new?

  * Complete rewrite of application core which means more stable, maintanable,
  faster image viewer for GNOME
  * New plugin system which allows developers to extend EOG's UI and behavior.
  Python support is available.
  * Editable application toolbar
  * New image collection pane with on-demand thumbnail loading, polished look,
  and continuous scrolling side buttons.
  * Side Pane to be extended by plugins
  * New image properties dialog which replaces the image info sidepane
  * Single instance D-Bus-based activation support
  * Revamped error/warning UI
  * "Open with" support to quickly open images on other applications
  * Mouse scrollwheel improvements: HIG compliancy and zoom factor setting
  * General UI polishing
  * Command line options for fullscreen, slideshow and image collection
  disabling
  * Display EXIF MakerNotes
  * XMP Support
