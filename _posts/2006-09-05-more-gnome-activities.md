Yesterday, I gave a talk about the GNOME project for grad students from [Ruy
Barbosa](http://www.frb.br) Computing Science Faculty. Sandro, a great friend
of mine, was the host teacher. This talk is part of a series of free software
activities organized by [GNU Ruy](http://gnu.frb.br/), the Ruy Barbosa's free
software group. Some students got very interested in contributing to the
project (I've received e-mails at the same day).

I'm **very** happy to know that some of the people who have contacted to get
help on their first steps inside GNOME have already started to give their first
contributions. I've known of at least three people that have already sent their
first patches (some of them accepted!) and other three that are now part of the
brazilian l10n team. **Yay!**
