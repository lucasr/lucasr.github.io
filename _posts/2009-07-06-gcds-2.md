  * I'm eating too much. I'll definitely some weight here. It's funny that I
  haven't heard of anyone getting sick because of any food here. There's a lot
  "risky" food here... The "Sueco Especial" for example looked a bit scary at
  first :-P
  * Don't believe in what
  [Diego](http://blogs.gnome.org/diegoe/2009/07/05/gran-canaria-tidbytes-ala-vuntz/)
  and [Vincent](http://www.vuntz.net/journal/post/2009/07/05/GUADEC-tidbits-2)
  are saying! I understand (almost) everything people say in spanish here. It's
  amazing! Speaking spanish is another story though...
  * Could find any open restaurant at 1h AM last night! It was Sunday but
  still... Well, we ended up finding a open bar where we had some simple but
  good sandwiches.
  * I really liked the GNOME 3.0 talk today. It was useful to show how many
  cool things are happening for GNOME 3.0.
  * Went to a quick/informal GTK+ meeting today. I hope some the stuff
  discussed there turn into actual action soon.
  * [Daniel](http://home.cs.tum.edu/~siegel/news/2009_07_06-i_am_still_enjoying_gcds)
  is right, I'm 23 years old! :-P
  * For some weird reason, I ended up being the "official" photographer for the
  GCDS group photo! Terrible idea as I'm a lousy photographer! :-P (I'll
  publish it soon bt the way)
  * [GSettings](http://live.gnome.org/dconf) looks pretty interesting. Client
  side windows in GTK+ seems very promissing. Love Moblin's
  [Mojito](http://moblin.org/projects/mojito). [GNOME
  Shell](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell) is moving really fast.
  * [GNOME 1,2,3](http://www.grancanariadesktopsummit.org/node/198) talk was
  awesome!
  * More later!
