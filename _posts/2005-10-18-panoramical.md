I haven't being posting for a long time. So, I'll talk about some cool things I've done and seen in the last days...

**EOG**

I've been giving some love to EOG. It really needed it: lots of critical bugs
(crashes!) and a "dirty" bug list on bugzilla. So, I cleaned up
some [EOG
bugs](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?bug_id=133389,313003,318318,318734,162627,166681,127855,165187,300072,156274,308215,164247,305025,314566,)
by triaging and patching. I wrote a [Roadmap for EOG
2.14](http://live.gnome.org/EyeOfGnome) with the topics I think are relevant
for the next stable version. Sorry [Tim
Gerla](http://blogs.conary.com/index.php/tgerla) about all those messages on
IRC! I just want to keep you informed. :-)

**Mallard**

I love [Project Mallard](http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/quack/mallard.xml). The
GNOME docs really needs some revamping. Considering that the users don't read
docs _before_ they use the software (they do it _while_ they're using it), the
current "software manual" approach is not very nice. A context-based help is
much more useful here. Some random ideas about this:

  * We'll need a good search feature to make it easy to find the right answers
  the user is looking for. This involves good indexing for the help topics.
  * A new documentation for writing manuals will be necessary because the docs
  will be written using an hypertextual topic-based approach. Very diferent
  from the current linear one.

**Cool new projects**

Dogtail is a GUI test tool which will be VERY useful for QA stuff. It
will be possible to reproduce bugs and perform several GUI tests by just
writing Python scripts that interact with the user interface.

Tango (for GNU/Linux coherent desktop experience) and
[BetterDesktop](http://betterdesktop.org/) (an interesting GNU/Linux usability
effort) are great iniciatives!

**Kill Wanda?**

There is a very [funny
discussion](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2005-October/msg00134.html)
about what should be done with the old fish Wanda. Don't kill her! It has a
very historical meaning!

**Projeto Software Livre Bahia**

Our local [free software activism group](http://psl-ba.softwarelivre.org) has
made its 2 years of existence! Congrats to all of us! Some
[photos](http://public.fotki.com/libertarios/krishna/bebemorando_psl-ba/) from
our little party.
