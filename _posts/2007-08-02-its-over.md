Yestarday, I defended (via audio-conference) my mastering thesis entitled
"Software Livre e produção colaborativa na Internet: um estudo de caso dos
instrumentos de comunicação no Projeto GNOME" _(in english it would be
something like "Free software and collaborative production in Internet: a case
study of the communication instruments used in GNOME Project")_. I was
approved! It's over! Now I have master degree in Contemporary Culture and
Communication. Wohoo! :-)
