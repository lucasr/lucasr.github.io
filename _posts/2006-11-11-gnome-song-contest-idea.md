I have this idea of promoting a contest to choose the GNOME Song. IMHO, this is
kind of activity promotes community integration and helps creating passionate
users™. Also, having a GNOME Song would be cool for marketing stuff! My
intension is to put the several recordings of GNOME Song from several people
around the world in the GNOME CVS repository. l10n work could be done on
recordings with translated versions of the lyrics. Isn't it awesome!?

I've prepared a draft [here](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeSongContest). This is
far from complete/stable. I want suggestions about the submission process and
how to rate the submissions. Also, not sure about the best release date yet.

Comments?

_PS: Jono, this could a great oportunity for Jokosher to get more users. You
could release a tutorial teaching how to easily record melody submissions only
with rocking free software. :-)_
