This is my first post aggregated on both [Planet
Mozilla](http://planet.mozilla.org) and [Planet Mozilla
Mobile](http://planet.firefox.com/mobile/). I guess it's a good time to
introduce myself to the Mozilla community. I joined Mozilla about a month ago
to work on [Firefox  Mobile](http://www.mozilla.org/mobile). I'll be
mostly focusing on UI-related bits and pieces of
[Fennec](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec) as part of the front-end
group—which is in fact what I'm most passionate about.

Before Mozilla, I worked for three years at [litl](http://litl.com)—a
Boston-based startup—where I hacked on the cloud-based OS that powers the
[webbook](http://litl.com/meet-webbook/overview.htm). The litl OS is almost
entirely written in JavaScript and it was while working on it that I really got
hooked into the language. Before litl, I was part of Maemo's UI framework team
at Nokia where I worked throughout the entire development cycle of  the
[N810](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N810) internet tablet.

I'm also a long time [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/) contributor. I've done all
sorts of things in the project such as being a member of GNOME Foundation's
Board of Directors, being part of GNOME's release team, and maintaining a few
official modules. I don't hold any official positions in the project anymore
but I'm still working on a cool spare-time
[project](https://live.gnome.org/TheBoardProject) based on GNOME platform.

My first month at Mozilla has been great overall. To be honest, I felt a bit
overwhelmed in the first couple of weeks. It's a quite humbling experience to
join such a large community full of extremely talented and passionate
contributors. It's a whole new world to me and I'm learning quite a bit
everyday—which is the very reason I joined Mozilla anyway. I hope to be
blogging soon about the latest news on Fennec development. For instance,
there's some really exciting work being done on the tablet UI for
Fennec now! Stay tuned!
