So, here are my quick comment for the day:

  * Luis opening talk: quick and nice.
  * Release team meeting: we prepared some interesting slides.
  * Board meeting about where the next GUADEC will take place.
  * Had time to attend two talks: Clutter and Leisa Reichelt. Both pretty cool.
  * Spent the rest of afternoon working on the organization of the Drooling
  Macaque "concert" and jam session.
  * At night, "concert" and jam session: I think it was really fun! Thanks to
  everyone who participated by being part of the band or by just being a nice
  audience!
  * Tomorrow: maybe more small meetings, some talks to see, and boat party at
  night!
