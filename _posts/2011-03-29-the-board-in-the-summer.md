As you probably
[know](http://cfergeau.blogspot.com/2011/03/gnome-and-gsoc-2011.html) by now,
GNOME has been
[accepted](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2011) as
a mentoring organization in [Google's Summer of
Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2011) 2011.
Student applications period started yesterday! If you're a student excited
about GNOME, have a look at our [wiki
page](https://live.gnome.org/SummerOfCode2011) for more information and
[project ideas](https://live.gnome.org/SummerOfCode2011/Ideas)! Application
period ends on April 8.

This year I decided to mentor one project related to [The
Board](http://live.gnome.org/TheBoardProject). The idea is to implement a
[Tracker](http://projects.gnome.org/tracker/) storage for the app. Using
Tracker will allow us to implement smart searches in the app itself and expose
The Board's data to other desktop components.

So, if you're a student looking for an interesting project to hack on as part
of the Summer of Code this year, this is an exciting opportunity to work on a
cool app using bleeding edge GNOME technologies (Clutter, GTK+ 3, Gjs, Tracker,
etc).
