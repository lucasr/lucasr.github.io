So, as I [posted some days
ago](http://blogs.gnome.org/view/lucasr/2007/01/29/0), one of our goals for the
future [Hildon
Desktop](https://stage.maemo.org/svn/maemo/projects/haf/branches/maemo-af-desktop/hildon-desktop)
releases is scalability. We want to be able to easily configure/adapt the
desktop to different displays with different resolutions. As a proof of
concept, I made some very small code changes and some adaptations on the
development theme (aka Plankton) — created by [MDK](http://www.mdk.org.pl) and
[tigert](http://www.tigert.com) — and made Hildon Desktop usable on a
1024&#215;768 resolution on my laptop. It would rock even more if I had a
tablet PC here to use finger for interaction. Here's the result:
