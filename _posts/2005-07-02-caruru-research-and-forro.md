"Caruru is delicious" (2.11.0) is the first development release of zenity. It brings a bunch of improvements, cleanups, bug fixes, new and updated translations and features. Most of the improvements has been made on List dialog:

  * New —print-column option syntax: now you can define a comma-separated list of column indexes;
  * New —hide-column
  * Single and multiple selection
  * Double-clicking on rows

**Research**

Mastering classes has been quite cool with readings about ciberculture, technique phylosophy and virtual reality. I've been populating my [research wiki](http://gnosislivre.org/twiki/bin/view/CulturaHacker) with more and more content. I'll be writing with the great Vicente Aguiar (!) an article about gift culture, hacker culture and free software development communities.

We dance "[forró](http://www.google.com.br/search?q=define%3Aforr%C3%B3&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox&rls=org.mozilla:pt-BR:unofficial)" and eat a lot of baked corn and peanuts and fruit liqueur. I and Carol went to a friend's house at a district of Feira de Santana (a town near Salvador, the Bahia state capital where we live). Here are some photos:
