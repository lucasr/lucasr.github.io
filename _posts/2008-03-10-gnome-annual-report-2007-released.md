In 2006, Dave Neary and others started this new tradition by producing the
[first GNOME Foundation annual
report](http://foundation.gnome.org/about/gnome_annual_report_2006.pdf) which
has got very positive response from community. So, we decided to follow the new
tradition by preparing the GNOME Foundation annual report 2007!

I've been slowly working on it for a few months with invaluable contributions
from several people. The report is now
[available](http://foundation.gnome.org/about/gnome_annual_report_2007.pdf)
(1860 KB, PDF) in GNOME Foundation's website.

We'll soon send nice hard copies of the report to the Advisory Board members
and existing GNOME event boxes. Our plan is to also print a bunch of extra
copies to be used for promoting GNOME on events around the world. Feel free to
request some copies for your local GNOME event.

This year, we chose [Lulu.com](http://www.lulu.com) as the printing service in
order to allow us to easily print more copies on demand and to make it possible
to anyone to order personal hard copies by just paying for the printing (the
price goes 100% to Lulu.com, no revenues to GNOME Foundation). You can
buy a hard copy of this report directly from Lulu.com
[here](http://www.lulu.com/content/2038054).

Many thanks to:

  * the writers: Federico Mena-Quintero, Sayamindu Dasgupta, Vincent Untz and
  Behdad Esfahbod;
  * the photographers: Frederic Crozat, Michael Dominic, Vincent Untz, Kushal
  Das, Juan Carlos Inostroza and Garrett LeSage;
  * the designer: Andreas Nilsson;
  * the text reviewers: Paul Cutler and Stephanie Watson;
  * the adviser: Dave Neary.

**I hope you enjoy it!**

**Update 1:** In the first paragraph, when I wrote "Last year", I actually
meant "In 2006". I fixed this to add clarity. :-)

**Update 2:** The price for printing the report at Lulu.com doesn't include any
revenue to the GNOME Foundation! That's the price of the printing service which
goes 100% to Lulu.com! Yes, it's relatively expensive.
