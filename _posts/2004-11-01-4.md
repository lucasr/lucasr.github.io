I've been very busy on writing my mastering pre-project for the selection
process. Deadline is 3/11/04. The project will deal with issues like
posmodernist society, cyberculture, hackers and free software. I think this
will be very interesting.

Well, that's it. I hope to have some more free-hack-time after this hurry.
