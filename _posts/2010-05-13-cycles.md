Cycles, everyone has them. I have mine. I'm always alternating between two
modes: _processing mode_ and _production mode._

_Processing mode_ makes me very unproductive, introspective, and quiet.
It's when I'm trying give clear form to ideas. It's when I allow myself to not
produce. Or at least to not be as productive as usual. I step back, consider,
rethink, and let the thoughts flow. Then I feel bad about all the idleness
and try to switch to _production mode_.

_Production mode_ is a more earthy, hands-on, pragmatic, productive mode. It's
when I Just Fucking Do It ™. It's when all the _processing mode_ pays off. I
get to focus on getting things done. And then I burn out and enter _processing
mode_ again.

Every time I travel for longer than a week, I enter _processing mode_. Every
time I feel like a have a good idea, I try to switch to _production mode_ as
soon as I can. _Production mode_ generally lasts longer than _processing mode_.
Sometimes I keep digesting an idea for weeks, even months. Many ideas never
actually take form or get implemented. Some are done but don't quite work.

And life goes on — in cycles.
