I've taken the post of editor of [GNOME Planet](http://planet.gnome.org) with
[Vincent](http://vuntz.net) in 2009. Since then, the approval process for new
feeds received a couple of important improvements. First, we made the process
more transparent by [publicly
processing](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=component%3Aplanet.gnome.org+product%3A%22website%22+)
all requests in GNOME's Bugzilla. Secondly, we added clarity to the process by
writing down a set of [guidelines](http://live.gnome.org/PlanetGnome) detailing
how requests are processed.

But it's been some time that I haven't been dedicating enough time to process
new requests. It's time to pass the ball to someone who will be able to process
the requests more promptly while still ensuring the high quality of the
aggregated content. So, I hereby announce that [Alberto
Ruiz](http://aruiz.synaptia.net/) is now replacing me as co-editor of Planet
GNOME. He has already done a great job in processing existing requests and I am
confident that he'll continue to do so. Welcome Alberto!
