Sanna, a very close friend from Finland, lent me a [Mama's
Gun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mama's_Gun) CD back in 2007. I had no clue
who [Erykah Badu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erykah_Badu) was at that time.
It was the first ever [neo soul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_soul) album
I've listened to. This album has a very powerful sound and has been in my
recurrent playlist since 2007.

_Mama's Gun_ is a [gapless album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gapless_album).
This brings a sense of constant flow throughout the album. Feels like one big
track with different moods. You'll find an acid and groovy sound in the opening
track _Penitentiary Philosophy_ and some sexy stuff in _Hey Sugah_ and _Kiss Me
on My Neck_. There's some space for soft melodies too in the jazzy _Orange
Moon_ and in the famous [Bag Lady](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag_Lady).

As for the sound of the album, Erykah Badu's performance is simply amazing:
sexy, emotional, and very intense. I really love the fact that the drums are
acoustic and played by the
awesome [Questlove](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questlove) — who is also
co-producing. He brings a strong, earthy, and groovy sound to the whole album.

Every single track of _Mama's Gun_ has something cool. I generally listen to
the whole album without skipping any track. The gapless approach might have
some influence on that. _Mama's Gun_ is a soul album. Literally.
