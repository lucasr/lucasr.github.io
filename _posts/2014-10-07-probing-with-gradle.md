Up until now, [Probe](https://github.com/lucasr/probe/) relied on dynamic view proxies generated at runtime to intercept View calls. Although very convenient, this approach greatly affects the time to inflate your layoutsâ€”which limits the number of use cases for the library, especially in more complex apps.

This is all changing now with Probe&#8217;s brand new Gradle plugin which seamlessly generates build-time proxies for your app. This means virtually no overhead at runtime!

Using Probe&#8217;s Gradle plugin is very simple. First, add the Gradle plugin as a dependency in your build script.

<pre style="font-size: smaller;">buildscript {
    ...
    dependencies {
        ...
        classpath 'org.lucasr.probe:gradle-plugin:0.1.3'
    }
}</pre>

Then apply the plugin to your app&#8217;s _build.gradle_.

<pre style="font-size: smaller;">apply plugin: 'org.lucasr.probe'</pre>

Probe&#8217;s proxy generation is disabled by default and needs to be explicitly enabled on specific build variants (build type + product flavour). For example, this is how you enable Probe proxies in debug builds.

<pre style="font-size: smaller;">probe {
    buildVariants {
        debug {
            enabled = true
        }
    }
}</pre>

And that&#8217;s all! You should now be able to deploy interceptors on any part of your UI. Here&#8217;s how you could deploy an _OvermeasureInterceptor_ in an activity.

<pre style="font-size: smaller;">public final class MainActivity extends Activity {
   @Override
   protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
       Probe.deploy(this, new OvermeasureInterceptor());
       super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
       setContentView(R.id.main_activity);
   }
}
</pre>

While working on this feature, I have changed _DexMaker_ to be an optional dependency i.e. you have to explicitly add _DexMaker_ as a build dependency in your app in order to use it.

This is my first Gradle plugin. There&#8217;s definitely a lot of room for improvement here. These features are available in the 0.1.3 release in Maven Central.

As usual, feedback, bug reports, and fixes are [very welcome](https://github.com/lucasr/probe/). Enjoy!
