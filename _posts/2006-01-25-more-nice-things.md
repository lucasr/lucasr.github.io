Well, there were too many things to tell and, of course, I forgot some other
nice stuff.

We from [Paroano Sai
Milhó](http://www.tramavirtual.com.br/artista.jsp?id=20179) started to record
our first DVD show. Yay! Also, our website is under construction. Nice! :-)

My other band, now called
[Pretutu](http://www.tramavirtual.com.br/artista.jsp?id=5162) (the name WAS Pã)
started to record its first album. You can listen to some old dirty recorded
songs [here](http://gnosislivre.org/~lucasr/pa/). Well, recording sessions are
happening very often so I hope we can finish and release the album in the next
monthes. The album will be (probably) CC licensed. First, I need to convince
the other members of the band.

Last week, I went to the [Whitworth College
Jazz](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=whitworth+college+jazz+band&btnG=Search)
show at [Teatro Castro Alves](http://www.tca.ba.gov.br/). Nice show! There were
no super-mega-powerful-ultra instrumentist but as group the band is great! They
performed songs from Thelonious Monk and others.

Movies:

  * [The Lord](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/) [of the Rings](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167261/) [trilogy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167260/) (watched three times each movie!)
  * [Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0304141/) (nice!)

Music:

  * [Vanessa da Mata](http://www.vanessadamata.com.br/) (good dudes, very good)
