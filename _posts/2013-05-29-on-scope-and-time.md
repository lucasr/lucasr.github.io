Building user interfaces is an open-ended process. Just take any feature of
your product. Think about it. There are probably more than a dozen ways of
designing and implementing it. And there is never really a point in time when
you can consider it _done_.

Your assumptions are not really proven until you ship. You learn, adapt, tweak,
and add new features in response to feedback. As long as your product is
alive and you are listening to your users, you will be continuously
iterating design and code to improve your user experience.

Given the continuous nature of UI development, knowing where to draw the line
of _what_ will get into the hands of users and _when_ is a big deal. Why?
Because the way the design iterations and development cycles are framed through
time greatly impacts UI quality.

Designing and implementing user interfaces that stand out takes time. You
rarely get it right at first. It is an exploratory process that requires
designers and engineers to work [together](http://thelayout.cc/mind-the-gap/)
through countless iterations on sketches, specs, prototypes, and, of course,
the implementation.  Having an experienced and talented team might
accelerate the process a bit, but only up to a point.

UI excellence is highly dependent on how much space the teams are given to
explore different directions and to refine even the smallest details on the
final product. Spread too thin on too many fronts and you lose the ability to
dive deep in every aspect of the features at hand.

Think of UI quality as a hosepipe. If you want water to shoot farther, the most
effective way to do it is to simply use your finger to partially cover the tip
of the hose. This way, water will not only reach _farther_ but also run
_faster_.

In other words, if you want to raise your game, the most effective way to do it
is to reduce scope to allow your team to go deep on UI quality and attention to
detail. By sharpening your focus, you will also be able to ship and iterate
faster.

For a real-world example, see how Realmac Software
[approached](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/blog/why-shipping-on-time-is-hard)
their first release of Clear, an app that got a lot of attention for its
beautiful gesture-based user interface.

Simply put, they reduced scope to ship faster with higher quality—finger over
the tip of the hose.

Now, you might have thought the solution for the hose metaphor was to simply
increase the water flow i.e. allocating more resources to the project. Sounds
logical. However, growing the team is rarely an option for many organizations.
Besides, larger teams only give you a _potentially_ higher throughput. You
still need to care about focus and depth—which can be very challenging on a
larger scale.

In UI development, scope and time matter, a lot. The best user interfaces
usually arise from teams who are able to focus on less to go deeper into
details.
