I just read two books covering indirectly related topics which complement each
other. Those books together make a strong point about how businesses and our
jobs should be. The first book is Dan Pink's
[Drive](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6452796-drive) — which led me to
[write](http://www.lucasr.org/2010/03/27/the-third-drive-and-free-software-communities/)
a
[bit](http://www.lucasr.org/2010/03/30/some-extra-points-about-intrinsic-motivation-and-foss-communities/)
about the intrinsic motivations and the future of F/OSS communities by the way.
The second is [Rework](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6732019-rework) by
Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson.

_Drive_ is spot-on in clarifying the big mismatch between what science knows
and what business does with regards to motivation. Pink's [TED
talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html) summarizes very
well the point of his book. It's impressive, and even scary, how so many
businesses just don't get that when you settle on a culture of if-then rewards,
treat your employees like irresponsible children, micromanage people
all the time, you'll quickly kill their motivation. That's what
research has shown. We all want to do meaningful stuff, things that
allow us to get increasingly better on what we do. When people who
are passionate about their work are hired, companies should just let
them do their thing without many distractions. It works, trust me.

_Rework_ is a fucking awesome book. The authors are two guys from
[37signals](http://37signals.com/), the company that created the famous [Ruby
on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and other nice web apps. This book is call
for more down to earth, hands-on, simple, small, smart, flexible, efficient,
realistic businesses. The format couldn't be different: it's a set of short
and straight-to-the-point essays divided into sections like Progress,
Hiring, Promotion, Productivity, Evolution, etc. You'll see things like
"Meetings are toxic", "Underdo your competition", "Resumés are ridiculous",
"Build half a product, not a half-assed product", "Press releases are
spam", "Fire the workaholics", and many other awesome ideas in this book.
It was great to see many of the things I have always thought about and
expected from companies summarized in a book! Thankfully, this is mostly
what I've been experiencing at [litl](http://litl.com/) so far.

_Drive_ diagnoses the problem of motivation and _Rework_ brings powerful ideas
on how to actually do BS-free, hands-on, smart, and agile business.
