Spent this weekend having resting and watching some cool movies:

  * [The Crying Game](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104036/) (very good, great
  performance of Jaye Davison)
  * [Super Size Me](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390521/) (cool documentary, it
  reminded me that I need to make physical exercises urgently)

I've migrated zenity to use gnome-doc-utils. So, now It should be easier to
translate zenity manual. Go, go, go translators!
