Carol and I spent last weekend in Paris. It's an amazing city! Seeing the
paintings of the impressionists (Monet, Cézanne, Degas, Manet, Pissaro, Renoir)
and post-impressionists (Van Gogh, Signac, Seurat, Gauguim), and the
sculptures of Rodin was a extremely intense experience for me. We took lots
of pictures, have a look at our [photo
album](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasrocha/sets/72157601836840152/).
