This year, Carol and I decided to plan for some quick visits to smaller cities
around London. The reason is twofold. First, we wanted to explore a bit more
the country where we live. Secondly, we wanted to "practice" how it was to
travel with our little daughter before our [vacation in
Brazil](http://lucasr.org/2010/08/30/back-from-salvador/). We've made 1-day
trips to three towns: Windsor, Cambridge, and Brighton.

**Windsor.** We visited
[Windsor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor,_Berkshire) in the end of 2009
when my father and his wife came to London to spend Xmas and new year with us.
We went there for an obvious reason: the famous Windsor castle, one of
England's most popular places for tourists. It was a quite cold day but we
managed to enjoy the sightseeing anyway. Windsor, the town, is cute and very
quiet.

**Cambridge.** This was the first time we made a trip with Julia.
[Cambridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge) is a university-oriented
town full of students all around. We took the sightseeing bus and walked around
quite a bit — a very tiring experience to carry Julia in a sling during the
whole time. We went to some of the Cambridge's classic locations such as King's
College Chapel and Fitzwilliam Museum. Got a pretty good impression of
Cambridge, even though it seemed a bit too crowded with students.

**Brighton.** That was definitely our favourite town.
[Brighton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton) is on the south coast of
England. The pebble beach is a nice place to relax. Brightonians seem to be
easy-going people. It's amazing how the sea affects people's behaviour and
attitude. To be honest, Carol and I even considered moving there after the
visit but it would be a bit impractical to work in London and live there.

What all those towns have in common? A very obvious thing: you see more English
people. It may sound weird to say that but in London you don't really
experience English culture because the city is very cosmopolitan. Even though
those towns are not so far from London, it was interesting to notice that they
are more homogeneously English than London. I took some photos from

Where are we going next? We have some obvious suspects in mind: Oxford, Bath,
Stonehenge, Cotswolds, and others. We're also planning a weekend trip to
Edinburgh and surrounding locations. There's so much to see that is hard
to decide! But we have no hurry and summer is almost gone now. Maybe next
year, let's see.
