I started hacking on
[Pattrn](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lucasr.pattrn) six
months ago as a fun learning experiment. Pattrn was [first
released](http://lucasr.org/2012/05/07/introducing-pattrn/) in the beginning of
May. Since then, I've been listening very carefully to your feedback and a
[lot](http://lucasr.org/2012/07/24/pattrn-on-tablets/)
[of](http://lucasr.org/2012/05/28/get-a-new-wallpaper-every-day-with-pattrn/)
[the](http://lucasr.org/2012/06/04/discover-patterns-by-color-in-pattrn/)
[features](http://lucasr.org/2012/07/09/the-you-tab-in-pattrn/) I
[implemented](http://lucasr.org/2012/06/25/infinite-patterns-in-pattrn/) were
in response to your input. So, thank you!

Today, Pattrn reaches a major milestone: it has just been featured in Google
Play's Staff Picks—for both phones and tablets! If you love Pattrn, this is the
perfect moment to give it a 5-star rating on [Google
Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lucasr.pattrn)!

What's next? I'm now working on the next two major features for Pattrn—again,
in response to your feedback. Stay tuned!
