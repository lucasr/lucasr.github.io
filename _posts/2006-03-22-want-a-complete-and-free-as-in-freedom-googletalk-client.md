[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manioc) defines Tapioca as...

> ...a woody Shrub of the Euphorbiaceae (spurge family) that is extensively
> cultivated as an annual crop in tropical and subtropical regions for its
> edible starchy tuberous root, a major source of carbohydrate.

But for [INdT](http://www.indt.org.br/) guys Tapioca is...

[<img style="border: 0px initial initial;" src="http://lucasr.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/tapioca.jpg" border="0"/>](http://tapioca-voip.sourceforge.net)

> ...a framework for Voice over IP (VoIP) and Instant Messaging (IM). Its main

The lastest release brings full interoperability (SIP + Jabber) with
GoogleTalk. Also, there's a very [nice
client](http://tapioca-voip.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/ScreenShots) (which
needs some UI love). Experiment it! Installation guide is
[here](http://tapioca-voip.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Installation_Guide).
