Last week, we did our very first topic-oriented
[hackathon](http://lucasr.org/2013/04/22/firefox-for-androids-ui-polishing-hackathon/
"Firefox for Android's UI polishing Hackathon") focused on UI polishing
bugs. The UI changes we've done will make a substantial difference in the
experience of using Firefox on Android. Here are some of my favourite fixes and
improvements.

### Tabs

Details in the tabs UI can make a big difference UX-wise. We changed the tabs
button icon (see image) to provide better affordance. The new icon also
features a much cooler animation when tabs are added or removed.

Last but not least, we added a subtle parallax effect when you the open/close
the tabs panel giving it a more fluid feel.

### Address bar

As Wes has already
[reported](http://digdug2k.wordpress.com/2013/04/29/show-urls-in-fennec/ "Show
Urls in Fennec"), you now have the option to show URLs instead of page
titles in the address bar. The domain highlight (see image) is a nice touch and
gives us feature parity with Firefox on desktop.

The reader and stop buttons now have properly sized hit areas to avoid tapping
other parts of the toolbar by mistakeâ€”a long overdue issue.

### That's not all

Reader Mode will get some nice style updates for serif fonts, doorhanger
notifications now have a more polished animation, text selection handles have a
more consistent style, favicons in the awesomescreen will look
[fancier](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=839855), some visual
glitches in the awesomescreen and toolbar were fixed, and more.

Not all these changes are in [Nightly](http://nightly.mozilla.org/ "Nightly")
just yet but they will show up in the next days. Firefox 23 has everything to
be my favourite release _ever_. Download and install our
[Nightly](http://nightly.mozilla.org/ "Nightly") build on your Android and let
us know what you think.
