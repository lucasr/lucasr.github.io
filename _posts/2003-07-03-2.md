I've been wondering on what are the consequences of languages imposed
programming standards on the productivity on open-source projects...

Pre-defined programming language standards make it easy to understand code
written by other people because you don't need to read any aditional docs to
know how a certain application was organized.

For example, Java imposes a file/archive structure that must reflect the class
packages structure and suggests a standard for naming your class namespaces
(the reversed version of your domain: br.com.mysite.mypkg,
 org.opensourcetool.foopkg, etc). In my opinion, stuff like this make it easy
to understand more rapidly other's code because my hacking is already based on
a java universal pattern and not on a application specific one.

In languages like PHP, C/C++ (which doesn't impose any standards), every
application has its own way to organize &#8220;things&#8221;, and sometimes it
gets very hard to understand the internals of some program...

There are some tradeoffs of course! These standards may turn themselves into a
limitation factor on the development practice because they force you to think
in way that maybe is not what you think is apropriate.

well, that's it...
