**GNOME 2.14 released!**

After six months of hard work of contributors from all over this beaultiful
planet, GNOME 2.14 is released! Big thanks to all the people who contributed to
this awesome release! GNOME is powered by
[multitude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitude)!

**Cooking**

![](http://lucasr.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/bread.jpg)

Carol and I bought the recipes book. So, we **tried** to cook some nice
home-made bread. Our plan was to prepare some basic french bread and fogazza.
Well, this project really failed. The result was a lot of
hard-definitely-not-tasty bread! Some days later, we prepared a delicious
chocolate pie which made us keep believing that we're capable of doing
some nice food.

**EOG and Zenity**

I released EOG and Zenity 2.14.0 yesterday. Working on these litle GNOME
modules has been very nice and funny. I'll bring some 2.16 plans for them soon.

**III Fórum GNOME**

<img class="alignnone" src="http://lucasr.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/forum.png"/>

As most of you probably already know (from the gnome.org front page), the III
Fórum GNOME will happen as a community event of the 7th Fórum Internacional
Software Livre (FISL) on April 19-22, at Porto Alegre/RS. FISL is the biggest
free software event in Latin America. GNOME dudes, this is a very good motive
to come to Brazil! For this 3rd edition, the Fórum GNOME will have talks from
GNOME popstars Jeff "perky pants" Waugh and Nat Friedman and of
course from other vivid brazilian contributors. See our [official
site](http://forum.gnome.org).

**GNOME Journal & Behind the Scenes**

As you probably saw, I launched the **Behind the Scenes** series on the latest
[GNOME Journal](http://www.gnomejournal.org) issue. The idea is to bring to the
public the "human" side of our community with funny and informative profiles
from people who contribute to GNOME. I created a [wiki
page](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeJournal/BehindTheScenes) to organize ideas
about the interview itself and the potential interviewee candidates. As always,
I'm accepting contributions. GJ had more than 120.000 visits on march!
See GJ [stats page](http://www.gnomejournal.org/stats/).

**III Festival Software Livre Bahia**

<img class="alignnone" src="http://lucasr.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/festival.png"/>

The III Festival Software Livre da Bahia is the event of the free software
addicted/enthusiasts people from Bahia. It will happen on August 24-26 at Lauro
de Freitas/BA, a city near
[Salvador](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador%2C_Brazil). There's an open
[call for
papers](http://twiki.softwarelivre.org/bin/view/Festival3/ChamadaDeAtividades)
(in portuguese). See the [event website](http://festival.softwarelivre.org/).

**New Me**

I've got some new glasses! Now I look like a modern designer! Good bye Harry
Potter look! :-)

**Nice web things**

Two weeks ago I started to use some well-know services on web:
[Digg](http://digg.com) (story sharing), [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/)
(bookmarks sharing) and [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/) (music profiling). See
my Last.fm profile [here](http://www.last.fm/user/lucasrocha). The profile says
that my favorite genres are jazz, acid jazz and brazilian music. Oh, that's
totally right! My latest listenings:

  * [The Meters](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Meters)
  * [Morcheeba](http://www.last.fm/music/Morcheeba)
  * [Incognito](http://www.last.fm/music/Incognito)
  * [Jaga Jazzist](http://www.last.fm/music/Jaga+Jazzist)
  * [Jazzanova](http://www.last.fm/music/Jazzanova)
