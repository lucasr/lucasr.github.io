As engineers, I believe the way we approach a problem is as important as the
code we write. This is especially relevant in the context of UI engineering
where design is such a vital element.

Unfortunately, it seems quite hard to find good content about everything that
happens _around_ us and _inside_ our heads when we are building user
interfaces. This is what [The Layout](http://thelayout.cc) is about.

My [intent](http://thelayout.cc/preamble/) is to create a space for high
quality content discussing the principles, mindset, and practices that I
believe shape the craft of UI engineering. It is meant to be a shared space
with many voices—so, expect some awesome guest authors.

I’ve just posted the very first article, [Mind the
Gap](http://thelayout.cc/mind-the-gap/). My plan is to publish a new article
every other week-ish. For now, subscribe to the [RSS
feed](http://thelayout.cc/feed/) or simply follow The Layout on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/readthelayout) or
[Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/109366488041901352956/posts) to get
future updates.

I really hope you enjoy it!
