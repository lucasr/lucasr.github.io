As engineers, I believe the way we <em>approach</em> a problem is as important
as the code we write. This is especially relevant in the context of UI
engineering where design is such a vital element.

Unfortunately, it seems quite hard to find good content about everything that
happens _around_ us and _inside_ our heads when we are building
user interfaces. This is what <a href="http://thelayout.cc/">The Layout</a> is
about.

My <a href="http://thelayout.cc/preamble/">intent</a> is to create a space for
high quality content discussing the principles, mindset, and practices that I
believe shape the craft of UI engineering. It is meant to be a shared space
with many voices—so, expect some awesome guest authors.

I’ve just posted the very first article, <a
href="http://thelayout.cc/mind-the-gap/">Mind the Gap</a>. My plan is to
publish a new article every other week-ish. For now, subscribe to the <a
href="http://thelayout.cc/feed/">RSS feed</a> or simply follow The Layout on <a
href="http://twitter.com/readthelayout">Twitter</a> or <a
href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/109366488041901352956/posts">Google+</a> to
get future updates.

I really hope you enjoy it!
