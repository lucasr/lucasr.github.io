Designing apps for 7-inch devices can be a bit tricky due to the fuzzy nature
of this form-factor. The [Nexus 7](http://lucasr.org/2012/08/01/nexus-7/) gave
a big boost on the "small tablet" market for Android so it's important to
design your apps with these devices in mind.

What's is unique about the Nexus 7 form-factor is that it behaves quite
differently in each orientation. Yes, the same could be said about 10-inch
tablets and phones, of course. But they still generally provide a "lot of
space" and "not much space", respectively, in both landscape and portrait.

On the other hand, the Nexus 7 behaves "almost" like a phone in portrait and
"more like" a tablet in landscape. Therefore, UIs for 7-inch devices will
likely end up blending elements from both phone and 10-inch tablet layouts.

<div id="attachment_3165" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://lucasr.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/pattrn-7.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-3165   " style="border: 0px none;" src="http://lucasr.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/pattrn-7-thumb.png" width="500" height="199" srcset="http://lucasr.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/pattrn-7-thumb-300x119.png 300w, http://lucasr.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/pattrn-7-thumb.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a>

For example, in [Pattrn](http://pattrnapp.com), the UI for 7-inch devices
blends the flat list of patterns from phones with the sidebar from 10-inch
tablets when in portrait mode; while in landscape it uses the sidebar and a
two-column grid, which is more like the 10-inch tablet UI. Also, on 7-inch
tablets, the search entry is iconified by default in portrait and expanded by
default in landscape to maintain visual balance in each orientation.

<div id="attachment_3174" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://lucasr.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/firefox-7.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-3174 " style="border: 0px none;" src="http://lucasr.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/firefox-7-thumb.png" width="500" height="199" srcset="http://lucasr.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/firefox-7-thumb-300x119.png 300w, http://lucasr.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/firefox-7-thumb.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a>

[Firefox for Android](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/mobile/) is another
example of this blend. Firefox's UI for 7-inch devices adopts the more powerful
toolbar with forward/back buttons from 10-inch tablets but uses the same
vertical fly-in tabs tray from phones.

Designing for 7-inch tablets is about finding the perfect blend between the
phone and the larger tablet UIs.
