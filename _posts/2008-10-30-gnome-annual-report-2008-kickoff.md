It’s time to start working on our 2008 annual report (actually, we're already
late...)! Last year we had a very [nice
report](http://foundation.gnome.org/about/gnome_annual_report_2007.pdf). So,
let’s make it even better this year! I’ve created a [wiki
page](http://live.gnome.org/FoundationBoard/AnnualReport2008) to organize the
work. The current content is just an initial proposal. Feel free to add your
ideas there.

Any kind of contribution is welcome! There are several ways to help:

  * Assign yourself to write one of the sections
  * Add links, references and other information sources to help writers to
  produce the content
  * Add new ideas, suggest, review the content
  * Add links to high resolution photos of GNOME people
  * Anything else! :-)

I'll soon start to directly contact some people for specific tasks (as this is
a more effective way of getting volunteers). Anyway, if you want to
help and/or have any questions, feel free to contact
[me](http://live.gnome.org/LucasRocha).
