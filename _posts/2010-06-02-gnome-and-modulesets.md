I've just sent the Release Team
[proposal](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/devel-announce-list/2010-June/msg00000.html)
to reorganize the GNOME modulesets. Constructive feedback is more than welcome.
The focus is on better promotion of our platform — especially now that things
are finally getting cleaned up in GTK+ and GLib — and bringing app developers
closer to our community. The proposal touches a few of the main points I
[discussed](http://lucasr.org/2008/06/15/notes-on-the-future-of-gnome-problems-and-questions/)
a couple years ago. A few quick personal notes:

**Focus on core.** By having only core components in our Desktop moduleset,
we'll be able to focus our attention on the core user experience. This will
hopefully make it more natural to discuss the "big picture" more often
without too much distraction.

**Focus on platform.** There's some great work being done in terms of cleaning
up our platform and adding some long-waited features to it. All this work
combined with a [good launch plan for
3.0](http://live.gnome.org/ThreePointZero/MarketingRoadmap) will definitely
improve the communication around our platform and hopefully attract developers
to create new appealing GNOME apps.

**App portfolio.** We have this vast app ecosystem around GNOME which is much
bigger than our official modulesets. Having a strong app portfolio is key for a
good promotion of our platform and to have a constant flow of new developers in
the community. We have to spread the word about the awesome things that have
been created based on GNOME: Banshee, Tomboy, GNOME Do, Brasero, Cheese,
F-Spot, Shotwell, Inkscape, and many many others.

This proposal is a result of countless conversations among release team members
and several members of the GNOME community. I really hope it will allow GNOME
to embrace a bit more all the innovation that has been happening outside our
"official" boundaries.
