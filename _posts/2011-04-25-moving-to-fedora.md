After many years using Ubuntu as my primary distro, I'm now moving to Fedora.
I've installed F15 Beta on my personal laptop during this long weekend and
spent a few hours getting my development environment back together. I have a
few reasons for moving to Fedora.

## Ubuntu and GNOME 3

Ubuntu now has an uncertain user story for GNOME 3. They will provide a PPA for
Natty with GNOME 3 but it pretty much comflicts with the official packages. Not
ideal as I just want GNOME 3 out of the box.

## GNOME 3 full time

So far, I've tried GNOME 3 on the live images and while doing GNOME releases
but never used it for longer than a few days. I wanted to start using it full
time as soon as possible and Fedora provides exactly that.

## Red Hat and upstream

I have always had great respect for the big contributions that the Red Hat guys
give to GNOME and other upstream projects. I want to support them in a more
concrete way.

## Out of comfort zone

I've recently decided to do a few things to get me out of my comfort zone.
Changing distros is one of them. It's not a big deal really—at least for me
anyway—but it's a step on a not-so-comfortable direction. I'll surely learn a
few things on the way.

Except for the apparently broken Eclipse in F15—couldn't get the Android ADT
plugin to install—and a few glitches and rough edges here and there, the
experience has been quite good so far.
