[Chris](http://chrislord.net/) and I will be giving a talk about [Firefox for
Android](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/mobile/) next Friday on the 22nd of
February at the London Mozilla Space. Join us to learn a bit more about the
current state of Firefox for Android and our plans for 2013.

We'll talk in detail about how we run
[Gecko](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko) on Android, the
past and future UI iterations, our graphics/rendering platform, and more!

The schedule is pretty simple. The doors will be open at 18h30 and we'll start
at 19h. The talk will be followed by free drinks and pizza in our community
space. Interested? Register now at the [event
page.](http://firefoxandroid.eventbrite.com/) Hope to see you next week!
