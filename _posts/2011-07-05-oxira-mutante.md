Davi Moraes is mostly known as the guitarist who played with famous Brazilian
artists like Caetano Veloso and Vanessa da Mata. He's a remarkable sideman but
his solo albums are well worth having a look. _Orixá Mutante_ is Davi's second
album released in 2004.

The album opens with _Ganzá_ which has one of the grooviest guitar riffs I've
ever seen. _Som das Ruas_ follows with high-vibe funky beat. _Pretoriana_ and
_I'm Still in Love with You_ bring the reggae sauce to the pot. _Tô na Sua_ is
a slow tempo funky balad with amazing vocalized guitar solos. _Liquidificador
de Orixás_ is a punchy afrobeat a la [Femi
Kuti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femi_Kuti). The album also features the
original recording of _Café com Pão_ which became a big hit a few years later
in [Salvador's
carnival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador,_Bahia#Carnival.2FCarnaval).

_Orixá Mutante_ is a great showcase of what I consider the best side of [axé
music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ax%C3%A9_music). A fusion of all sorts of
music genres, from Afro-Caribbean to funk. Style-wise, this album is similar to
some of the best stuff by [Carlinhos
Brown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlinhos_Brown) such as _Omelete Man_
which is, in my opinion, Brown's greatest masterpiece. What differentiates Davi
from Brown is his lyrical style as well as his strong focus on the overlayed
guitar riffs.

This album should definitely be in your playlist if you enjoy good afro-groovy
music!
