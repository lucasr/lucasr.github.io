[Freddie Hubbard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Hubbard) is one of my
favourite jazzists. Surely one of the greatest jazz trumpeters of all times. He
recorded albums as a leader and sideman with many of the greatest: John
Coltrane, Herbie Hancock, Art Blakey, Joe Henderson, Wayne Shorter, Ornette
Coleman, Woody Shaw, and many others. He has a furious and groovy sound. A
style that can actually be seen in the way he plays (see the photo above). He
became more popular during the 1970s with a series of albums recorded for CTI
Records including a sort of trilogy of funk-influenced hard bop albums: [Red
Clay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Clay), [First
Flight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Light_(Freddie_Hubbard_album)), and
[Straight
Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_Life_(Freddie_Hubbard_album)). The
last one is quite special to me.

I bought a _Straight Life_ CD __back in 2007 when I was still living in
Finland. As I mentioned in a [previous
post](http://lucasr.org/2010/05/01/how-i-enjoy-music/), I found a very nice
record shop in Helsinki — close to
[Kamppi](http://www.kamppi.fi/uk/default.aspx) — and I used to go there
every other weekend to pick new albums more or less randomly. _Straight Life_
was the first-ever Hubbard album I tried. I became a fan almost instantly!

The personel is full of stars: Joe Henderson (Sax), Herbie Hancock (Electric
Piano), Ron Carter (Bass), Jack DeJohnette (Drums), George Benson
(Guitar), Richard Landrum (Percussion), and Weldon Irvine (Tabla/Tambourine).
The album has three tracks: _Straight Life_, _Mr. Clean_, and
_"Here's That Rainy Day"_. The order of the tracks is an
exact match on my personal rank. _Straight Life_ is an amazing 17 minute (!)
performance. _Mr. Clean_ is a nice medium tempo funky tune.
_"Here's That Rainy Day"_ is a ballad — but Hubbard
is not good with ballads in my opinion. I love this album mostly because of
the track that names the album.

Hubbard starts _Straight Life_ with some fast arpeggios alternated with
DeJohnette's drumming. It's like a musical greeting. Makes you
curious about what's to come. Then Hubbard starts the theme and the band
follows. The rhythm is hard to explain. It's a bit amorphous and very
rich in complexity. It's some sort of afro-latin thing. It's
interesting how the soloists make such a complex rhythm sound so natural. The
solos by Henderson and Hubbard are my favourite. This was the first time I
heard Henderson playing. The great moment of his solo is when he plays the
theme in a different scale on top of an unexpected harmony played by Hancock.
Hubbard starts his solo with a very soft sound and then moves on to a faster
and high-pitched solo.

_Straight Life_ (the album) introduced me to Freddie Hubbard and Joe Henderson
at their best and I've been enjoying their albums a lot since then. This
album is definitely in my top 10 list. You can read reviews of this album at
