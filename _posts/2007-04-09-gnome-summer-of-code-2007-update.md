It's been a while since the Summer of Code 2007 started. So, it's a good time
to give you a quick update about what's been happening.

We received 174 applications this year—just a little bit less than last year
(181). The overall quality of the applications is good. Therefore, we expect to
have some really nice projects in 2007. :-)

As decided in the first [GNOME SoC organization
meeting](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2007-February/msg00024.html),
the final list of chosen applications will be decided by a selection
committee composed by ~10 well-known GNOME community members. The
selection committee members were either invited by the SoC admins or
explicitly volunteered to be part of the committee.

The SoC selection committee is composed by:

  * Christian Kellner
  * Murray Cumming
  * Christian Schaller
  * Paolo Borelli
  * Raphaël Slinckx
  * Bryan Clark
  * Lucas Rocha
  * Federico Quintero
  * Shaun McCance
  * Behdad Esfahbod
  * Thomas Wood
  * Ryan Lortie
  * Vincent Untz

It's good to remark that the participation of the community (with ranking and
valuable comments) has been helping us a lot. Thank you!

We are giving our best in the selection process and we expect to be giving the
results in the next couple days.
