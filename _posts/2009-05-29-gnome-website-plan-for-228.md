We're working hard to have a beta version of the GNOME website by September 21,
GNOME 2.28 release. I'm trying to keep everyone very focused in a clear and
concrete plan:

The May 27 milestone was a total success! So, what do we have now? The
Content team (working with the <a
href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeMarketing">Marketing team</a>) has
the initial plan for the <a
href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWeb/TwoPointTwentyseven/Content">content
structure</a>. The Design team has published the <a
href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWeb/TwoPointTwentyseven/Design">initial
design proposal</a> for the website. The CMS team has set an initial plan for
the basic content, front page, translation and deployment. The <a
href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWeb/Plone">Plone work</a> is all being
documented in our wiki.

The next milestone (June 15) is about consolidating the content structure,
delivering the final design in an implementable form (HTML/CSS), setting up a
test website in GNOME servers and having front page and basic content types
implemented in our Plone instance. <a
href="http://www.silwenae.org/blog/">Paul</a> is now working on mapping the
content that was <a
href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWeb/NewWgoStructure">previously produced</a>
to make sure we reuse it as much as possible. <a
href="http://www.andreasn.se/blog/">Andreas</a> and <a
href="http://vdepizzol.wordpress.com/">Vinicius</a> want feedback on the
proposed design and will be working on implementing the design in HTML/CSS
during this milestone so that it can be easily applied in our Plone website.
