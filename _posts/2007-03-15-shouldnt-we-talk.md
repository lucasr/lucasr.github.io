The number of GNOME-Platform-based user interfaces (or "Desktop environments"
if you prefer) for embedded devices is growing.  AFAIK, those are the
guys in the field:

We have different focuses: [OLPC](http://www.laptop.org/) (Sugar) on education,
ACCESS on PDAs, [Maemo](http://www.maemo.org/) (Hildon Desktop) on Internet
Tablets and [OpenMoko](http://www.openmoko.org) on cellphones. However, I'm
sure we have a lot to share and learn with each other in terms of architecture,
UI framework, plugin systems, standards, code, ideas, and so forth.

I saw that (probably) there [will](http://www.guadec.org/node/591)
[be](http://www.guadec.org/node/561) [some](http://www.guadec.org/node/528)
[talks](http://www.guadec.org/node/526) related to those projects in GUADEC.
This means that we will all be at the same place, at the same time, It's a good
oportunity for us to get together and talk! So, what do you think?

**Update 1**: It seems that some very interesting discussion among OLPC, Maemo
and OpenEmbedded guys already took place during <a>Bossa Conference</a>. Good
to know we're already talking. :-)
  
**Update 2**: Someone commented that I should add [LiMo
Foundation](http://www.limofoundation.org/sf/sfmain/do/home) to the list. Does
anyone know if there will be anyone from LiMo at GUADEC?
