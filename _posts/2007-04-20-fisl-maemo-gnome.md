So, one week after [FISL](http://fisl.softwarelivre.org), I have time and
energy to post something about it. I've been attending FISL for 4 years and I
can say for sure this was the best edition ever in terms of content and
organization. Of course, I'm a little bit biased by the fact this was my first
time in Brazil since I moved to Finland. :-)

To my surprise, there were 4 [Maemo](http://www.maemo.org/)-related
talks/workshops in the agenda: my talk, Python in Maemo by Osvaldo Santana
([INDT](http://www.indt.org.br)), Maemo development workshop by Osvaldo, and
Tapioca & Telepathy intro by Daniel Carvalho (INDT).

The GNOME brazilian community meeting was great. As a result, we came out with
there major actions:

  * **GNOME Brasil website revamp**. Migrate our [current
  website](http://br.gnome.org) to a [wiki system](http://www.twiki.org/)
  hosted at [softwarelivre.org](http://www.softwarelivre.org) in order to
  enable collaboration and decentralization on content creation.
  * **GNOME promotion in Brazil**. Produce, translate and reuse marketing
  material to use on small, medium and large free software conferences in
  Brazil. Also, we'll trying to have more people giving talks and workshops
  about GNOME from the user and developer point of view.
  * **Mapping GNOME users in Brazil.** I'm sure Brazil is one of the biggest
  users of GNOME today. However, we don't know anything about the organizations
  that are currently using GNOME all over the country. Some time ago, I gave
  this [idea](http://blogs.gnome.org/view/lucasr/2006/03/28/0) as a GNOME-wide
  activity but I got no response.
  [Federico](http://primates.ximian.com/~federico/news.html) did something
  similar in the context of system administration info last year. So, we'll be
  doing this only in Brazil for now.

It was nice to meet some heroes there: [John](http://www.j5live.com),
[Alvaro](http://www.alobbs.com), [Jono](http://www.jonobacon.org),
[Jim](http://www.gettysfamily.org/wordpress/),
[Aaron](http://aseigo.blogspot.com), and [Keith](http://www.keithp.com).
Specially, it was awesome to meet some of my best friends. Most of them are now
working hard in a free software based services cooperative called
[Colivre](http://www.colivre.coop.br).
