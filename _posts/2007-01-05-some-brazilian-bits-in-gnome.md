I remember a couple years ago the brazilian presence within the GNOME community
was quite small. On the code development front, there were only
[Guilherme](http://live.gnome.org/GuilhermePastore) and me. The brazilian l10n
team was lacking new contributors and the heavy translation work used to be
concentrated among just a few people.

Today, ~2 years later, we have many more brazilians hacking on GNOME. Here are
the new heroes:

  * **Carlos Eduardo Rodrigues Diogenes**: co-maintaining gnome-mag;
  * **Bruno Boaventura**: bugsquad member, hacking on metacity and helping EOG;
  * **John Wendell**: hacking on vino;

On the l10n front, our team has some good news too. The brazilian l10n Ubuntu
team is joining efforts with us. Now they will contribute translations directly
to upstream (GNOME) and then import their work with Rosetta in Ubuntu. Because
of this, the GNOME brazilian l10n team received new contributors. I'm sure this
will have a direct (positive) impact on the quality of the brazilian portuguese
translation of GNOME 2.18. Special thanks to:

  * **Og Maciel**, for the great effort to integrate the Ubuntu and GNOME teams;
  * **Leonardo Fontenelle**, for the great effort to make the brazilian portuguese translation rock.

I'm sure I'll be bringing more good brazilian news for GNOME from now on! **Go
Go Go Brazil!** :-)
