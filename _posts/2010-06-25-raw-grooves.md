It's hard to define what [groove](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groove_(music))
is. It's a combination of swing, rhythm, and use of space. Usually it arises
from the right interaction of sounds from the rhythm section — drums, bass,
guitar, and keyboards. You know when it's there and you know when it's
not. [Maceo Parker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maceo_Parker), a groove
maven, usually starts his concerts with something like this:

> We'd like to present 2% Jazz and 98% funky stuff. This is known as happy
> music. Happy music is when you hear it, you start moving and shaking
> something automatically!

I love groovy music. But I have especial preference for more raw grooves. By
raw I mean the grooves that are powerful because they are imperfect, human,
noisy and full of energy. Grooves are becoming too synthetic,
metronomic, clean, and perfect nowadays. They often lose the point. So,
here's a quick list of some of the raw groovy tunes I love.

**Sex Machine by James Brown.** Yes, the classic one. It's full of energy and
has a tight groove. Great example of use space between bass, guitar, and drums.

**Shake Everything You've Got by** **Maceo Parker.** He is one of the most
prominent disciples of the James Brown "university" — as he usually says. This
song is all about enjoying the moment. My favourite version is in the album
_Life on Planet Groove_.

**Rocks by** **Brecker Brothers.** They are a great jazz fusion duo — Michael
on sax and Rangy on trumpet. I first heard _Rocks_ in one of the 5 Brecker
Brothers albums I bought last year. The groove arises from the alternation of
bass and guitar lines on top of a powerful drum beat.

**Cissy Strut by** **The Meters.** This is a classic groove — for those into
funky stuff. _Cissy Strut_ is a slow-tempo funky song. Great use of space,
packed with swing. The drum beat is simply awesome!

**Serpentine Fire by** **Earth Wind & Fire.** Ok, it's quite hard to pick only
one tune from those guys. They have a countless number of amazing groovy songs.
Serpentine Fire has such a great vibe. Maurice White delivers a great singing
performance, packed with energy.

As I said, this is just quick list. Groove is everywhere and, because it's a
subjective thing, people tend to have different favourite artists groove-wise.
What are your favourite raw grooves?
